               Welcome to xtrek.  Xtrek is the latest  in  a  line  of
          games  based  on  empire  on  the plato system.  Most of the
          ideas are based on the unix game _t_r_e_k_8_3 by David  Davis  and
          Chris  Guthrie and on the VMS game _c_o_n_q_u_e_s_t by Jef Poskanzer
          and Craig Leres.  Xtrek is a  multi-player,  real-time  game
          which  runs  under  Ultrix 1.2 on X supporting workstations.
          The daemon program must be run on on the Ultrix machine.  On
          the  same machine, the player program _x_t_r_e_k is run, throwing
          a  window  up   on   a   workstation.    Please   send   any
          ideas/comments to chris@ic.

               When you enter the game, you enter a galaxy as  one  of
          four  competing  races.  You have a warship at your command.
          The galaxy  contains  forty  planets,  which  start  divided
          evenly  between  the  four  teams.  The eventual goal of the
          game is to conquer the other teams' planets and protect your
          own.   Usually  this  will involve frequently having to kill
          other players while avoiding their efforts to kill you.


          _3.  _S_t_a_r_t_i_n_g _t_h_e _G_a_m_e

               To enter the game type _x_t_r_e_k _m_o_n_i_t_o_r:_0 much like any  X
          tool.   A  third argument, 0-3, allows you to choose a team.
          Not choosing a team on the command line leads to having  one
          randomly  assigned.   In terms of ship and planet abilities,
          all teams are identical.   Assuming  everything  is  working
          properly (including xhosts) you will be placed in the game.

               When you start the game, you  are  given  two  windows.
          The  left  window is your local view.  You will see a number
          of objects in it.  Your ship is always in the center of  the
          window.   Other  ships will look like yours except that each
          team has a different ship design.  The small  character  (in
          hex)  is  used  for  differentiating  player  number.  Round
          objects with names on the are planets.  Each team has a dif-
          ferent  color  to  distinguish its planets and ships.  Small
          dots on the screen are torpedoes.  You will come  to  recog-
          nize these after they kill you a few times.  Enemy torps are
          a different shape than your team's torps.  Small circles are
          exploding  torps.   Lines  between  ships  are phaser shots.
          They are never friendly.
















               The right window is a map of the  galaxy.   Only  ships
          and  planets appear on it.  Ships are just a player name and
          team number.

               The mouse is the most important interface.   When  ever
          the  game needs a direction, to turn your ship for instance,
          it will use the mouses position relative to  your  ship,  in
          whatever  window the mouse currently located.  Torpedoes and
          phasers will be fired toward the mouse, and your  ship  will
          turn in the direction of the mouse when appropriate keys are
          hit.  Most commands are  issued  through  the  keyboard  and
          mouse buttons.


          _6.  _S_t_a_t_u_s _L_i_n_e

               The status line appears at the bottom of the local win-
          dow and contains the following useful information:


          _6._1.  _F_l_a_g_s -- _s_h_i_p _s_t_a_t_u_s _f_l_a_g_s

               Various flags tell the player that about his ship.

              S -- Shields up
              R -- In Repair mode
              B -- Bombing a planet
              O -- Orbiting a planet
              C -- Cloaked (not implemented)
              W -- Weapons overheated
              E -- Engines overheated
              u -- Beaming up armies
              d -- Beaming down armies



          _6._2.  _x _b_y _y -- _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _g_a_l_a_c_t_i_c _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n

               The galaxy is 100,000 by 100,000.  This is your  ship's
          current position in it.


          _6._3.  _d_i_r -- _C_u_r_r_e_n_t _d_i_r_e_c_t_i_o_n

               This is the direction your ship is pointing in.  256 of
          these units represent a full circle.

















          _6._4.  _s - _s_h_i_p'_s _s_p_e_e_d

               This is the speed your ship  is  currently  travelling.
          Ships move between warps 0 and 9.


          _6._5.  _d_a_m - _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _d_a_m_a_g_e

               This is how much damage your ship  has  taken.   If  it
          gets  over  100,  you die.  Damage repairs slowly if shields
          are down, faster if ship is in repair mode.


          _6._6.  _s_h_d - _c_u_r_r_e_n_t _s_h_i_e_l_d_s

               Shields start out at 100 and take damage when they  are
          up.   When they hit 0, damage will come off your damage rat-
          ing.  They repair faster than real damage.


          _6._7.  _t -- _n_u_m_b_e_r _o_f _t_o_r_p_s _l_a_u_n_c_h_e_d

               Each player is limited to twelve torps  flying  at  any
          given time.  This is a count of the torps you currently have
          in the air.


          _6._8.  _a_r -- _a_r_m_i_e_s _o_n _b_o_a_r_d

               This is a count of the number of  armies  you  have  on
          your ship.  Your ship can carry two times the current number
          of kills.  The maximum number of armies it can carry is ten.


          _6._9.  _p_l -- _c_o_u_n_t _o_f _p_l_a_y_e_r_s _i_n _t_h_e _g_a_m_e

               This number is a quick count of how many other  players
          are in the game.


          _6._1_0.  _f_u_e_l -- _h_o_w _m_u_c_h _f_u_e_l _y_o_u _h_a_v_e _l_e_f_t

               Weapons and engines take fuel to run.  This is a  count
          of  the  amount  of fuel left on the ship.  Fuel regenerates
          slowly in space, but faster when orbiting a planet.


          _6._1_1.  _w_t_p -- _w_e_a_p_o_n_s _t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_u_r_e

               Using weapons drives up this stat.   If  it  goes  over
          100,  there is a good chance your weapons will freeze up for
          a random amount of time.  The temperature drops over time.














          _6._1_2.  _e_t_p -- _e_n_g_i_n_e _t_e_m_p_e_r_a_t_u_r_e

               Running your engines at speeds over five  cause  engine
          temperature  to climb.  Over 100, engines can also freeze up
          for a random amount of time.


          _7.  _T_h_e _c_o_m_m_a_n_d_s

               These are the various key and button  commands  in  the
          game.   They are currently bound, but this will go away at a
          later time.


          _7._1.  _S_h_i_p'_s _s_p_e_e_d

               The numbers zero through nine set  your  ship's  speed.
          It  takes  time for your ship to accelerate or decelerate to
          the desired speed.  Damaged ships can't use  higher  speeds.
          When  engines  freeze,  you  can't set speed.  Setting speed
          breaks you out of a planet's orbit.


          _7._2.  _k - _s_e_t _c_o_u_r_s_e

               The letter _k and the right mouse button set your course
          towards  the  current  mouse  position.  Turning towards the
          desired course can take  time,  depending  on  your  current
          speed and damage.


          _7._3.  _t - _l_a_u_n_c_h _t_o_r_p_e_d_o

               The letter _t and the left mouse button launch a torpedo
          towards the current mouse position if you have fuel and less
          than twelve torps currently out.  Torpedoes travel  at  warp
          twelve and do thirty points of damage when they hit someone.
          You cannot be hurt by your own torps.


          _7._4.  _p - _f_i_r_e _p_h_a_s_e_r

               The letter _p and the  middle  mouse  button  fire  your
          phasers towards the current mouse position if you have fuel.
          You may only fire phasers once per second.  They cost a good
          deal  of  fuel.   If  they  hit  someone, they will do 0-100
          points depending on the range.


          _7._5.  _d - _d_e_t_o_n_a_t_e _o_t_h_e_r _t_o_r_p_s

               This command will detonate other torps near you,  doing
          less than maximum damage to you.













          _7._6.  _D - _d_e_t_o_n_a_t_e _y_o_u_r _o_w_n _t_o_r_p_s

               This will turn your own torps off (if you've missed) so
          that you can fire new ones.


          _7._7.  + - _p_u_t _s_h_i_e_l_d_s _u_p

               This key will put your shields up.  Raised shields will
          take damage.


          _7._8.  - - _p_u_t _s_h_i_e_l_d_s _d_o_w_n

               This key will put your shields down.


          _7._9.  _u - _t_o_g_g_l_e _s_h_i_e_l_d_s

               This key will toggle your shields"


          _7._1_0.  _R - _r_e_p_a_i_r _d_a_m_a_g_e

               If your ship is moving at warp zero, this  will  repair
          damage at a faster rate.


          _7._1_1.  _o - _o_r_b_i_t _a _p_l_a_n_e_t

               If you are near a planet and going  warp  two  or  less
          this  will  put  in  orbit  around it.  You must be in orbit
          around a planet to bomb it, beam armies up or down,  or  get
          fuel from it.  Enemy planets will damage you if you get near
          them.  Setting speed will break orbit.


          _7._1_2.  _b - _b_o_m_b _a _p_l_a_n_e_t

               If an enemy planet has more than four armies,  you  can
          bomb  them.   With less than five armies, you must beam down
          armies to defeat them.  Your shields will go down  to  bomb,
          however,  and you will take damage from the planet.  You get
          kills for the armies killed.


          _7._1_3.  _z - _b_e_a_m _u_p _a_r_m_i_e_s

               If your planet has more than four armies, you can  beam
          them  to  your  ship to carry to other planets.  You must be
          orbiting to beam up armies.















          _7._1_4.  _x - _b_e_a_m _d_o_w_n _a_r_m_i_e_s

               This command will beam armies on your ship down to  any
          planet you are orbiting.  If it is an enemy planet, you will
          kill his armies.  If all are killed and you  land  an  army,
          you take the planet for your team.


          _7._1_5.  _L - _g_e_t _p_l_a_y_e_r _l_i_s_t

               This gives you a quick list of other players.


          _7._1_6.  _P - _g_e_t _p_l_a_n_e_t _l_i_s_t

               This gives you a list of planets.  You get  information
          only  on  planets  which  your  team  owns or has previously
          orbited.


          _7._1_7.  _i - _i_n_f_o _o_n _o_b_j_e_c_t

               This will pop up a window near the mouse which contains
          information about the nearest object (planet or ship).


          _8.  _N_i_t_t_y _G_r_i_t_t_y

               Eventually, there will be something to say  here  about
          nifty  details,  but since they are not necessary to play, I
          haven't done them yet.
