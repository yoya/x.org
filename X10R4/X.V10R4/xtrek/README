This is quickly how to run xtrek on a ultrix system.

Create an appropriate directory for it.  The defs.h
file contains the paths to this directory.  If you
don't want it in /usr/games/lib/xtrek, change this
file.

Before running make, look for random.o.  I found
that the ultrix library version wasn't very random,
so I substituted the 4.3 one which worked better.
If you don't have/want the 4.3 random.o, just delete
the reference in the make file and it will compile
with the one in libc.a.

Run make.  Install xtrek in /usr/games.  Robot and
daemon must be in /usr/games/lib/xtrek.  Copilot can
go anywhere.  Create the files .motd, .scores, and
.planets in /usr/games/lib/xtrek.

Xtrek, copilot, and the daemon must all be setuid
to someone who has write permission on these files.
Root is fine.  There are no real security holes in
the game.  If you want to avoid this, take out the
shared memory chmoding and make the dot files writable.

If you want to change constants in the game, it is
pretty well set up to allow tweaking.  Most of the
constants are in defs.h.  Player constants were defined
in getship.c in plans for a future custom designed ship
option.
