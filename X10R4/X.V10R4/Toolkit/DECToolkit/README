	capability of a standard X toolkit. The value of this particular
	package is the model upon which it is based: namely the isomorphic
	relationship between tool instances and "X" windows, the
	extensibility, and the aspect of geometry management for
	sub-window based forms.
 	
	Digital does not intend to support this tool kit package as a
	standard product, and cautions users and developers not to base
	product quality software on it.
	
	At present, Digital is working with Hewlett-Packard and others to
	define a standard "X" toolkit specification, and with HP, plan to
	propose that specification as a standard. The impementation of
	this standard toolkit is to be placed in the public domain.
	Digital does intend to provide a toolkit package (based on an
	agreed upon standard) in the X version 11 based workstation product.
 
	Some of the functionality in the submitted specification is not
	present in the software.  The major examples are menus and the
	integration of scroll bars and text sub-windows. The specification
	has more detail on this.  Furthermore, we would deeply
	appreciate comments on this specification. The result would
	be a better standards proposal from Digital. Please send comments:
