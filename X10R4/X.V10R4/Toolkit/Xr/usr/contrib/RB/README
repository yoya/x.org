	This directory contains the source for two programs,
        Raster Builder and Convert.


        Raster Builder is an interactive program which allows
        the editing of bitmaps or pixmaps.  It is intended more
        to show X-ray functionality than as a comprehensive
        application but still has enough functionality to allow
        the creation of images and storage and retrival of the
        images.  

        To make Raster Builder run MakeRB.

        To run Raster Builder execute "RB display".


	Convert reads a raster image file created by the raster
	builder and printf's a series of strings which are
	suitable for using as an include file.

        To make the file run MakeConvert.

	To run convert execute "convert arg1, arg2" where arg1 is the
        name of the raster image file, and arg2 is the name of
        the structure which will contain the raster image.

        The most useful way to run convert is to redirect the output
        into a file which can then be compiled into a program.
