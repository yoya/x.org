The X window system is a network-transparent, portable window system
developed by Project Athena and the Laboratory for Computer Science at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with funding and
participation by Digital Equipment Corporation and International
Business Machines, Inc.  X is now appearing on computers made by an
increasing number of companies.  This enables network-transparent X
applications to operate seamlessly across diverse machine
architectures and networks.
.P
The low-level programming interface to the X window system is
contained in the Xlib library, also called the X library.  Three
additional sets of routines are included with the standard Xlib as
minimal program development tools: XMenu, Xtext, and Xtty, documented
as part of appendix A in this manual.
.P
However, Xlib by itself is not sufficient for a programmer to easily
develop applications that have advanced user interface features such
as pop-up menus or panels filled either with standard interactive
gadgetry (such as push buttons or scroll bars) or with custom
gadgetry (such as thermometers or gauges) that the programmer might
care to develop.
.P
To fill this need, Hewlett-Packard's X-ray User Interface Project
developed the Xrlib user interface library, which is documented in the
remainder of this manual.  Xrlib provides a message-based programming
interface to user-interface components.  Hewlett-Packard has
contributed Xrlib to Project Athena's release of X to increase the
usability of X and thereby build a large community of X users.
.P
Although it is generally acknowledged that the standard X distribution
needs a user interface library that is well-matched to X, the
definition of a standard X user interface library has only just begun.
The relation between the eventual standard and Xrlib (or any other
publicly available user interface library) hasn't been determined.
.B
Therefore, it can't be guaranteed that any easy porting path will
exist between Xrlib and the eventual standard.
.R
Xrlib is not provided to dictate a
.I
de facto
.R
standard, but rather to prompt discussion in
the X community about what is needed in a standard and to assist those
whose current needs require immediate availability of a user interface
library, even if it isn't a standard.
