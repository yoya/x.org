Other files:
 makefile   - Make file used print revised parts of manual
              and to create "index" program.
 idx.lex    - LEX file used to define "index" program.
 MakeAll    - Script that prints entire manual except MAN pages.
 MakeChap   - Script that prints one chapter or appendix.
 MakeMan    - Script that prints all MAN pages.
 MakeConIdx - Script that prints contents and index.

Executing program files:
 make index               - Creates "index" program using the
                            "makefile" and "idx.lex" files. This
                            must be done BEFORE trying to print the index
                            (unless you print the manual using "make").
 make {all new pr00 prii} - Makes all manual parts, revised manual parts,
                            contents, or index.
 MakeAll                  - Composes and prints entire manual (including
                            contents and index), but not the MAN pages.
 MakeChap {1 2 3 4 5 a b} - Composes and prints one chapter, compiles contents
                            and index information in .con and .idx files.
 MakeMan                  - Composes and prints all MAN pages.
 MakeConIdx               - Concatenates current contents and index
                            information, composes and prints them.

Note:
 The "makefile" file for the make utility hasn't been fully tested. The
 script files were used to generate the actual manual.

Assumptions:
 The MakeAll, MakeChap, and MakeConIdx scripts use "eroff" and the
 LaserJet Plus printer. "eroff" is a product of ELAN that uses
 "soft fonts" compatible with the LaserJet Plus.

 If your system isn't compatible with these scripts, you should change
 them to use "troff" or "nroff" and to route the output to the appropriate
 device.
