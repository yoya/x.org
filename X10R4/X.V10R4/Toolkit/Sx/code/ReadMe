This directory contains the code for Sx, a library of supplemental
routines for the X window system.  If you've just de-archived the
library from the Berkeley distribution, type "make fixup" (this
recreates subdirectories that ar can't handle, and may do other
random fixups too, if they become necessary).

To recompile the library, type "make":  this will produce an
archive-format library file sx.a which can be installed, along with
sx.h, in a convenient place for users to get at them.  There is
also a demonstration program "sxDemo", which you can recompile by
typing "make sxDemo".

Send comments and suggestions about the Sx package to
