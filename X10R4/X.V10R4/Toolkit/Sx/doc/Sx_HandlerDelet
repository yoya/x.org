.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure destroys an association between a class of
events and a procedure, which was previously established
by a call to Sx_HandlerCreate.  After this call completes,
\fIhandler\fP is defunct;  its procedure will not be invoked
anymore, and the caller should not use \fIhandle\fP again.
.PP
Note:  when a window is destroyed, Sx automatically deletes all
handlers associated with the window.
