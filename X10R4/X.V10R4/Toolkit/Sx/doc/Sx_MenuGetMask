.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
At any given time, some of the entries in a pull-down menu may
be disabled.  When the menu is displayed, disabled entries are
drawn with a slash through them and may not be selected;  the
menu action procedure for an entry will not be invoked as long
as the entry is disabled.  If every entry in a menu is disabled,
then the title for the menu is drawn with a slash through it.
Applications typically disable entries when the
functions of that entry do not make sense given the current
state of the application.
.PP
Sx_MenuGetMask returns a mask indicating which entries in
the given menu are currently selected.
The Sx_MenuSetMask procedure is used to disable or re-enable some or all
of the entries in a menu.  It returns a mask indicating
which entries were enabled before the call.
