.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These two procedures allow callers to query and change the range
displayed in the ``elevator'' of the scrollbar associated with
\fIwindow\fP.  The range
of a scrollbar is indicated by two values, \fItop\fP and \fIbottom\fP,
both between 0.0 and 1.0 inclusive.  
For example, if \fItop\fP was 0.0 and \fIbottom\fP
was 0.5, it would mean that the top half of the object is visible in
the window.  For a horizontal scrollbar, it would mean that the left
half of the object is visible in the window.  The elevator displayed
in the scrollbar has its top (or left) edge \fItop\fP of the way along
the length of the scrollbar, and its bottom (or right) edge \fIbottom\fP
of the way along the length of the scrollbar.
.PP
Sx_ScrollbarSetRange does not affect in any way the view in the
window associated with the scrollbar;  all it does is update the
range of the elevator drawn in the scrollbar to reflect the new
values of \fItop\fP and \fIbottom\fP.  It is up to the caller to
make sure that the range of the scrollbar and the view in the
associated window remain consistent.
