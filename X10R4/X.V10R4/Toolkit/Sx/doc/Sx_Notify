.AS FontInfo *message
.AP Window parent in
Window in whose coordinates \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are given.
.AP int "x, y" in
Location of upper left corner of notifier, in coordinates of \fIparent\fP.
If either coordinate is less than zero, it defaults to a value that
will center the notifier in \fIparent\fP.
.AP int width in
Width of notifier, in pixels.  If less than or equal to 0, then
a default width is chosen (based on the size of \fImessage\fP) to
give the notifier a ``nice'' aspect ratio.
.AP char *message in
Text to be displayed in notifier.  It need not contain any newline
characters;  in this case, Sx_Notify will automatically break \fImessage\fP
into lines that fit in the notifier.  Newlines may be used in \fImessage\fP
to force line breaks, leave blank lines, etc.
.AP FontInfo *fontPtr in
Describes font to use in the notifier.  If NULL, the Sx default font is used.
.AP Boolean center in
If TRUE, then each line will be centered in the notifier.  Otherwise,
lines will be left-justified.
.AP char *option in
One or more options to be displayed at the top of the notifier window.
The list of options must be terminated by a NULL value.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sx_Notify is used to display a message and wait for the user 
to select one of several options.  A window pops up on
the screen to display \fImessage\fP and each of the \fIoption\fPs,
then Sx_Notify waits for the user to press a mouse button 
over one of the options.  The procedure will not
return until the user selects an option.  When this happens, it
returns the index of the selected option, where zero corresponds to the
first option specified in the parameters to Sx_Notify.
.PP
The notifier is always created in RootWindow so that it will be visible.
Sx_Notify grabs the X server, which prevents the user from doing
anything on the screen until he or she responds to the notification.
Notifiers are intended for usage in situations where a simple ``yes''
or ``no'' answer can be given without much thought.  In situations
where the user may need to look around and use other windows to decide
what to do, a more permanent window should be created, in a way that
doesn't lock up the server.
