.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sx_Unpack cancels the effect of a previous call to Sx_Pack or
Sx_CreatePacked.  From now on, \fIchild\fP's location and size
will not be managed automatically by the Sx packer.  \fIChild\fP
will be unmapped and the arrangement of its parent's other children
will be modified to reflect \fIchild\fP's removal from the packing
order.  \fIChild\fP is not deleted.
