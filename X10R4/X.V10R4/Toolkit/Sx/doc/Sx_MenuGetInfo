.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Sx_MenuGetInfo returns detailed information about a menu, given the
window containing its name.  The return value is a count of the number
of entries in the menu, or -1 if \fIwindow\fP isn't a menu window
at all.  In addition, the locations referred to by \fIentries\fP,
\fIfontPtrPtr\fP, \fIforegroundPtr\fP, and \fIbackgroundPtr\fP get
filled in with information about the menu's entries, font, and colors.
All of this information is identical in structure and meaning to the
information passed to Sx_MenuCreate.
The string pointers stored in \fIentries\fP all refer to strings stored
in the menu manager as part of the menu;  they should not be modified
by the caller, nor should they be used at all after any future actions
that could have caused the menu to be destroyed.
