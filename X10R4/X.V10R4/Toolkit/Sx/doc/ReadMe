This directory contains all of the man pages for all of
the Sx documentation.  The man pages can be printed with
the nroff/troff/ditroff family of typesetting programs,
but require a special set of macros, which are in the file
"macros".  To print the man page for foo, type
"troff macros foo".

The file Sx contains an overview of the Sx facilities, and
most of the other files describe individual Sx procedures.
The files sxDemo.c and sxButton.c contain sample programs.
Unfortunately, if you recieved this file in an "ar" distribution
then all of the file names will have been truncated to 15
characters.  This means that the names of some of the files
won't match the names of the procedures documented in the
files.
