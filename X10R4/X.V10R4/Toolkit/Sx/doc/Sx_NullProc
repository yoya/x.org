.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure does nothing except return immediately.  Its main
purpose is in arranging for events to be ignored.  For
example, Sx_HandlerCreate(window, KeyPressed, Sx_NullProc, (ClientData) NULL)
will cause KeyPressed events to be ignored when the pointer is over
\fIwindow\fP.  If the dummy handler had not been created, the keystrokes
would have been passed through to window's parent.
