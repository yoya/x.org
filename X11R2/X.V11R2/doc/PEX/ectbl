.LP
The attributes of the editing context resource are defined as follows:

.Bl "structure_id"
This attribute of an editing context resource contains the resource
id of the structure that is to be edited.

.Bl "element_ptr"
This attribute contains the offset of an element in a structure.  It is
used in conjunction with the editing context's structure id attribute
in order to determine the editing position.
Whenever an editing context is used as a destination in a structure
editing request,
the element pointer attribute will be updated as a side effect
of the operation.

.Bl "editing_mode"
This sets the editing mode attribute for the editing context. 
If the mode is \fIStructureInsert\fP, 
output requests used to create structure elements
will cause elements to be inserted into
the specified structure.  Elements will be
inserted into the structure
\fIafter\fP the structure element specified by the
element pointer.  The element pointer will then be
incremented by the number of elements inserted.
If the mode is \fIStructureReplace\fP, output
requests used to create structure elements
will cause structure elements to
replace elements starting at the location specified by the
element pointer.
