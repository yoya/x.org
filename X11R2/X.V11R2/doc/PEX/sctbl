The attributes of the search context resource are defined as follows:

.Bl "search_pos"
This attribute specifies the search reference position in world coordinates.

.Bl "search_dist"
This attribute specifies a distance from the search reference position.
A successful search occurs only when an output primitive element is found
that satisfies the search filter criteria \fIand\fP is within the
specified distance from the search reference point.

.Bl "search_ceiling"
This attribute defines the ceiling of the search operation.
The search ceiling is an index into the list contained in \fIstart_path\fP.
Searching stops when the end of the structure specified by
\fIsearch_ceiling\fP is reached.
If the ceiling is zero, the search operates without
a ceiling.

.Bl "start_path"
This attribute defines the structure network path that is to be used
as the starting point for the search.  Searching begins at the element
\fIfollowing\fP the one indicated by the start path.

.Bl "incl_list"
This attribute contains the list of name set resource id's to
be used as inclusion sets in the search operation.

.Bl "excl_list"
This attribute contains the list of name set resource id's to
be used as exclusion sets in the search operation.
