\fIWhat is X3D?\fP
.IP
X3D is group of individuals and companies interested
in defining and tracking 3D graphics extensions
to the X Window System.
The first meeting of this organization was in June, 1987.
X3D will soon be an official subgroup of the
X Consortium.

\fIHow can I get more information about the X3D group?\fP
.IP
For more information, contact the chairman of the X3D group,
Bert Herzog, of the University of Michigan (bert@citi.umich.edu).
.LP
\fIHow often are X3D meetings held and how are they announced?\fP
.IP
X3D meetings are being held on an as-needed basis.  The recent history
has been one about every three months.  Meetings, announcements, and
discussions are held via an electronic mailing list.  There is currently
no other mechanism (e.g., mailing flyers by U.S. mail) for disseminating such
information, so interested people are encouraged to join the mailing
list.  No provisions have been made for people without e-mail capability,
so such individuals should locate someone with e-mail access who can
forward any announcements that are sent out.
.LP
\fIHow do I get added to the X3D mailing list?\fP
.IP
You can be added to the X3D mailing list by sending a request to
x11-3d-request@athena.mit.edu.
.LP
\fIWhat does X3D do?\fP
.IP
The X3D group is currently focusing on an effort called X3D-PEX.
.LP
\fIWhat is X3D-PEX?\fP
.IP
X3D-PEX (or simply, PEX) is an extension to the X Window System
that is designed to efficiently support PHIGS and PHIGS+ across
a performance range of X server platforms.  A further goal of this
effort is to define the PEX specification and to do a public implementation
of the specification in a timely fashion.
.LP
\fIWhat is the PEX Architecture Team?\fP
.IP
The PEX Architecture Team is a small group of X3D members
that was formed after the
June, 1987 meeting.  This group of individuals was responsible
for revising and finalizing the PEX specification by November, 1987,
and will attempt
to provide guidance to the individuals involved in the public
implementation effort in much the same way that Bob Scheifler provided
guidance to the X11 implementation effort.
.LP
\fIHow can I submit comments on the PEX protocol specification?\fP
.IP
Comments on the PEX specification document may be addressed to the
whole X3D organization (via x11-3d@athena.mit.edu) or to the Architecture
Team only (via x3d-at@3d.dec.com).  It is too late to submit comments
on the goals or direction of PEX, as the specification period ended
in November.  However, comments about specifics are always welcome
(although they are likely to have less and less effect on the specification
as the implementation effort proceeds).
.LP
\fIHow can I report minor errors or typos that I find in the PEX documents?\fP
.IP
To report minor errors or typos,
contact the PEX Document Editor (rost@decwrl.dec.com).

\fIHow can I obtain a copy of the PEX specification?\fP
.IP
To obtain a copy of the PEX specification documents,
contact the PEX Document Editor (rost@decwrl.dec.com).
The documents are currently not intended for public consumption or
for curiosity-seekers.  We are asking that people who obtain
the documents contribute to the PEX effort by seriously reviewing
the documents and offering comments or encouragement, and consider
how they or their company can contribute to the implementation effort.
People should be aware that the PEX  specification may change
slightly as the implementation proceeds.  A final version of the
PEX specification will be issued in conjunction with the release
of the public implementation software.
.LP
\fIWhen can I expect to see PEX products?\fP
.IP
The schedule for the public implementation will be determined by those
involved in that effort.  The X3D organization makes no promises or
commitments on behalf of its member organizations.  It is incorrect
to assume that contribution to the public PEX effort implies a commitment
to produce PEX products.  That decision is left to the individual
member organizations.
