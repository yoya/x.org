.LP
The pick device descriptor components, in order,
are listed in the following table.
The abbreviation
"pick dev. dep." stands for "pick-device-dependent", meaning that the
default value is determined by the pick device type.
The abbreviation
"draw." means that the default value is determined from the drawable
bound to the PHIGS workstation resource at the time it was created.

The components of the pick device descriptor are defined as follows:

.Bl "pick_status"
This attribute contains the initial pick status that will be
bound to a pick measure resource.

.Bl "pick_path"
This attribute contains the initial pick path that will be
bound to a pick measure resource.

.Bl "pick_path_order"
This attribute specifies
the order in which elements of the picked path are to be written
into a pick measure resource.  If the order is \fITopFirst\fP,
elements of the pick measure's \fIpicked_path\fP attribute will
be listed in the order they would have been encountered during
a traversal, while if the order is \fIBottomFirst\fP they will
be listed in the opposite order.

.Bl "pick_inclusion"
This attribute specifies the resource id of the name set resource that is to be
used as the pick inclusion filter during picking operations.

.Bl "pick_exclusion"
This attribute specifies the resource id of the name set resource that is to be
used as the pick exclusion filter during picking operations.

.Bl "pick_data_rec"
This attribute contains
a pick-device-dependent data record used to initialize a pick measure
resource when it is created.

.Bl "prompt_echo_type"
This attribute
contains an enumerated type value that specifies the prompt/echo type
to be used during picking operations.  The allowable types are described
in the "Extension Information" section.

.Bl "echo_volume"
This attribute specifies
where prompting and/or echoing is to occur.

.Bl "echo_switch"
This attribute specifies the
initial echo state for a pick measure.
