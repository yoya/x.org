This directory contains the source for the PEX V3.00 Protocol Specification
document and the accompanying cover letters.  The makefile is set up to take
advantage of PostScript formatting program "psroff".  You will need to
edit the makefile if you want to use something other than psroff.


Making the document -

make -
	"make" with no arguments causes the protocol document to be formatted
	and sent to the printer.

make toc -
	Causes the protocol document table of contents to be formatted
	and sent to the printer.  Prior to doing a "make toc" you must have
	"made" the protocol document itself so that the table of contents
	information is available.

make ps -
	Causes a formatted PostScript file to be generated for the protocol
	document.  The "doc.ps" file can be sent to the printer at a later
	time.

make tocps -
	Causes a formatted PostScript file to be generated for the protocol
	document table of contents.  The "toc.ps" file can be sent to the
	printer at a later time.  Prior to doing a "make tocps" you must have
	"made" the protocol document itself so that the table of contents
	information is available.

make doc.txt -
	Causes nroff to be used to format the protocol document and send
	its output to the file "doc.txt".  This generally produces somewhat
	annoying results, since the document is designed to "look nice" when
	run through {t,ps,dit}roff, but not when run through nroff.

make toc.txt -
	Causes nroff to be used to format the protocol document table of
	contents and send its output to the file "toc.txt".

make cover1 -
	Causes cover letter #1 to be formatted and sent to the printer.

make cover2 -
	Causes cover letter #2 to be formatted and sent to the printer.

make cover3 -
	Causes cover letter #3 to be formatted and sent to the printer.
