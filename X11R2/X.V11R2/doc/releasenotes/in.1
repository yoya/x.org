The X Window System is a portable, network transparent window system 
originally developed at MIT.  It is supported on a wide range of raster 
display devices,
from simple monochrome frame buffers to deep, true color graphics processors.
This document describes the contents of this distribution, how it has changed
since the previous release, and how to configure, build, and install the
X Window System.

Overview
.LP
This is the second release of Version 11 of the X Window System from MIT.
It is substantially more robust than the previous version and should provide a
solid foundation upon which applications may be developed.  
No changes have been made to
the X Protocol; the Resource Manager and the extension mechanism were the
only parts of Xlib that were changed in incompatible ways.
However, the
command line arguments for specifying the server to contact and the default
geometry for an application's main window have been changed in all supported 
clients.  Also, the format for specifying default resources has been changed.

This release contains two separate distributions:  one for software that
is supported by the staff of the X Consortium, and one for user-contributed
software that is provided ``as is'' as public service.  Furthermore, 
printable versions of many documents are provided separately from the source
code to make loading subsets of the release easier.  Over time, we expect 
there to be migration in both directions between the two distributions.
.LP
The document \fIX Window System Protocol, Version 11\fP is the final
authority on what is and is not part of the core X Window System protocol.
The server provided in this distribution is a sample implementation, not
a specification of how servers must be written.

.LP
This release contains four higher level toolkits to make designing and
implementing applications easier:
.IP "\fIX Toolkit Intrinsics\fP"
.br
Currently under review by the X Consortium for possible 
inclusion in the X standard, this package provides a collection of resource, 
event, and object managers that may be used to build user interface objects
called \fIwidgets\fP.  A sample set of widgets is provided. 
Sources are located in \fIlib/Xt/\fP and \fIlib/Xaw/\fP.
.IP "\fIXrlib\fP"
.br
This is a collection of User Interface utilities and higher-level objects
written by Hewlett-Packard.  Future releases will use the X Toolkit Intrinsics.
Sources are located in \fIcontrib/Xr11/\fP.
.IP "\fIAndrew Toolkit\fP."
.br
Developed by IBM and Carnegie-Mellon University for the CMU Andrew System, 
this package provides a collection of integrated, high-level objects and 
applications.  Sources are located in \fIcontrib/andrew/\fP.
.IP "\fIInterViews\fP"
Developed at Stanford University, this package 
provides tools for building user interface objects in the C++ programming
language.  Source are located in \fIcontrib/InterViews/\fP.
.LP
The X Toolkit has changed substantially since the last release (note
that it is now called ``Xt'' instead of ``Xtk'').  Although 
additional functionality will probably be added in future releases,
the interfaces documented in the \fIX Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language X
Interface\fP are expected to remain fairly stable.
.LP
For wider portability, applications should include the new header file
\fI<X11/Xos.h>\fP instead of \fI<strings.h>\fP,
\fI<string.h>\fP, \fI<time.h>\fP, \fI<sys/time.h>\fP, \fI<fcntl.h>\fP, 
or \fI<sys/file.h>\fP.
.LP
To make transition from X10 to X11 easier, a protocol converter that 
allows binary X10 programs to be run on X11 displays has been provided.
In addition, this release uses ``X11'' instead of ``X'' wherever there is
a conflict with X10 files of the same name (e.g.
\fI/usr/include/X11/\fP, \fI/usr/lib/X11/\fP, \fP/usr/bin/X11/\fP, 
and \fI-lX11\fP).  All programs should now #include X header files using
``<X11/\fIfile\fP>''. 
.LP
This release should build and install without modification on machines running
the following operating systems:  4.3bsd, Ultrix 2.0, SunOS 3.4, HP-UX 6.01, 
and Apollo Domain/IX 9.7.
