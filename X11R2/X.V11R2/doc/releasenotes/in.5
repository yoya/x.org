.IP "X11/"
.br
This directory contains copies of all of the public headers used in X 
client programs.  This entire subtree gets copied to the directory specified
by the INCDIR configuration parameter in \fIutil/imake.includes/Imake.tmpl\fP
(by default, \fI/usr/include/X11\fP)
during the ``make install'' phase.  \fBAll programs should use 
``<X11/\fIfilename\fP>'' when #including X header files.\fR
.IP "X11/bitmaps/"
.br
This directory contains a number of single plane images stored 
in \fIbitmap(1)\fP format
(read and written with the Xlib routines \fIXReadBitmapFile\fP and 
\fIXWriteBitmapFile\fP).  They are often #included in C programs and may be 
used as background tiles with \fIxsetroot\fP utility.  Also, the X Toolkit
allows users to specify the names of files in this directory to be used
as cursor.  For more 
information, see the manual page for \fIbitmap(1)\fP and the
file \fIutil/bm-convert/bm-convert.doc\fP.
.IP "clients/"
.br
This directory is the top of the user program source tree.  There are 
other programs in the \fIdemos/\fP and \fIexamples/\fP trees, but they
are for demonstration purposes only.  A number of other very useful
user-contributed programs can be found under \fIcontrib/\fP.
.IP "clients/bitmap/"
.br
This directory contains 
an editor for creating and modifying single plane bitmap images (such
as the ones stored in \fIX11/bitmaps/\fP) used in defining two color
tiles (for doing stipple-filled areas) and masks (for clipping and 
specifying cursor images).
All resources can be specified both from the command line and in your
defaults.  In addition, a new
``-nodashed'' option prevents \fIbitmap\fP from using dashed grid lines.
.IP "clients/uwm/"
.br
This directory contains 
the most mature, publicly available window manager for X.  It has had
several bugs fixed (including menu color specifications and setting the
save-unders on popup windows, although the sample server still doesn't 
implement this attribute), but
is essentially the same as it was on the previous release.
.IP "clients/x10tox11/"
.br
This directory contains
an X10 to X11 protocol translator.  It masquerades as an X10 server,
converting X10 requests into X11 requests and X11 events into X10 events
(i.e. it is not a libnest implementation).  The \fIx10tox11\fP program
allows X10 programs to be run unmodified on an X11 server, making 
converting from X10 to X11 much easier.
.IP "clients/xbiff/"
.br
This directory contains
a simple little program that displays a picture of a mailbox whose
flag goes up when you get new mail.  It uses the Mailbox widget in the
Athena widget set.
.IP "clients/xcalc/"
.br
This directory contains 
a desktop calculator program that emulates a TI-30, an HP-10C, and
a slide rule.  A number of bugs (especially problems with color displays)
have been fixed in this release.  This program should be rewritten as
a collection of widgets.
.IP "clients/xclock/"
.br
This directory contains 
the standard X clock program.  It can display the time in either analog
or digital format.  It uses the Clock widget in the Athena widget set.
.IP "clients/xedit/"
.br
This directory contains
a simple text editor built on top of the X Toolkit.  
.IP "clients/xfd/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for displaying the characters in a font.  
.IP "clients/xhost/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for controlling access to the display on a host by host
basis.
.IP "clients/xinit/"
.br
This directory contains a utility for
starting an X server and an initial client (usually a
terminal emulator) on systems that don't have support for doing so from
\fI/etc/init\fP.
.IP "clients/xload/"
.br
This directory contains
a program for monitoring machine load averages.  It displays a histogram of
the most recent load averages and is often used to monitor machines in a
network.  It uses the Load widget from the Athena widget set, which will 
need to be modified if you are porting X to a new operating system.
.IP "clients/xlogo/"
.br
This directory contains a 
program that uses the Logo widget from the Athena widget set to 
display the new X Window System logo.
.IP "clients/xlsfonts/"
.br
This directory contains a utility for listing the fonts that are available 
on a given server.  If you request long listings
from a server with many compressed fonts, your display will 
``freeze'' for a long time.
.IP "clients/xmh/"
.br
This directory contains a
visual interface to the MH mail handling system.
.IP "clients/xmodmap/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for remapping your keyboard.  It reads descriptions of
keyboard and modifier mappings and is usually run when you login or first
start up X.  This program has been completely rewritten since the last 
release.
.IP "clients/xpr/"
.br
This directory contains
utilities for printing screen dump of images obtained with \fIxwd\fP.
.IP "clients/xprop/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for examining the properties attached to a given window.
.IP "clients/xrdb/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for loading default resource definitions into the server.
It is usually run when you login or first start up X.  Now 
that \fIXGetDefault\fP has been changed to look at this information, \fIxrdb\fP
is \fBvery\fP useful.  This program has been completely rewritten 
since the last release.
.IP "clients/xrefresh/"
.br
This directory contains
a simple utility for refreshing all or part of your screen.  It
now uses a window with no background, by default, so that windows repaint
smoothly.  It also accepts geometry specifications so that you can refresh 
just part of the screen.
.IP "clients/xset/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for setting various personal preferences for 
keyclick, pointer acceleration, etc.
.IP "clients/xsetroot/"
.br
This directory contains a utility for setting the background of the root 
window.  It now works properly with color.
.IP "clients/xterm/"
.br
This directory contains
a VT102 and Tektronix 4014 terminal emulator.  A number of bugs,
especially in Tektronix mode have been fixed since the previous release.
It now uses the proper version of the X Toolkit.
.IP "clients/xwd/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for dumping images of windows.  It is usually used to 
take a snapshop of a window for printing or for later displaying with the
\fIxwud\fP program.  Some servers still have problems with XY format images.
.IP "clients/xwininfo/"
.br
This directory contains 
a utility for examining the various attributes of a window (such
as size, placement, window manager information, etc.).  It is frequently used
with \fIxprop\fP to examine the window hierarchy.
.IP "clients/xwud/"
.br
This directory contains
a utility for displaying images that were previously creating using
the \fIxwd\fP utility.
.IP "demos/"
.br
This directory contains several programs that are fun to watch, but are not
of much use beyond that.
.IP "demos/ico/"
.br
This directory contains
a neat program that rolls a many-sided (you get to choose among several)
object around the screen.  The new ``-faces'' and ``-colors'' command line
options are particularly recommended.  Some servers can't handle the 
``-dbl'' option when used with ``-faces''.
.IP "demos/muncher, demos/plaid/"
.br
These directories contain programs for drawing cute pictures.
.IP "demos/puzzle/"
.br
This directory contains a ``rearrange the tiles'' puzzle game for X11.
The major addition for
this release is the ability to have images on the tile faces.  If you have a
color display, try running ``puzzle -picture mandrill.cm''.
.IP "demos/wm/"
.br
This directory contains
the ``other'' window manager.  It is somewhat ugly, but it does do
title bars.
.IP "doc/"
.br
This directory contains all of the documents describing the standard 
distribution.  Manual pages for the various clients can be found in the 
individual program source directories. 
.IP "doc/HelloWorld/"
.br
This directory contains David Rosenthal's \fIHello, World\fP paper on using
toolkits.
.IP "doc/PEX/"
.br
This directory contains the proposed X3D-PEX specification for providing
Phigs and Phigs+ functionality.
.IP "doc/Protocol/"
.br
This directory contains the official specification of the X Protocol.  
This is the final authority of what is and is not part of the X protocol
and is part of the X standard.
.IP "doc/Server/"
.br
This directory contains several guides to porting the X server to new
platforms.
.IP "doc/Toolkit/"
.br
This directory contains the Specification for the X Toolkit Intrinsics.  This 
document now under review by the X Consortium for possible inclusion in 
the X standard.  This is the final authority on what is and is not part of the
X Toolkit Intrinsics.  This directory also contains documentation on the Athena
widget set.
.IP "doc/Xlib/"
.br
This directory contains the source for the Xlib programming guide and 
manual pages.
There is an untested script called \fIdoc/Xlib/Xman/expand.names\fP that will
rename the manual pages to match the names of the routines that they describe.
.IP "doc/bugs/"
.br
This directory contains a template for submittings bugs reports (see 
\fIdoc/bugs/bug-report\fP).  Please use this form when reporting bugs in the
supported distribution to \fIxbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu\fP.
.IP "doc/conventions/"
This directory contains the most recent draft of the new \fIInter-Client 
Communications Conventions Manual\fP.  \fBThis is required reading for all 
toolkit and window manager builders.\fP
.IP "doc/fonts/"
.br
This directory contains a proposal made by Digital Equipment Corp. for a
more descriptive scheme for naming fonts.
.IP "doc/releasenotes/"
.br
This directory contains the sources for this document.
.IP "examples/"
.br
This directory contains various example programs that don't belong anywhere
else.
.IP "examples/CLX/"
.br
This directory contains several samples of how to use the CLX Common Lisp
X interface.
.IP "examples/Xaw/"
.br
This directory contains several small programs that test out the various
Athena widgets.
.IP "examples/xev/"
.br
This directory contains a trivial program for looking at the information
that is returned in various Button and Key events.  It is useful for setting
up keymap files for \fIxmodmap\fP.
.IP "extensions/"
.br
This directory contains the source code for several sample server extensions.
.IP "fonts/"
.br
This directory contains the sources for various fonts and a compiler for
generating Server Natural Format files.  The user-contributed distribution
has a MetaFont GF format to X BDF format converter that font
enthusiasts may find very useful.
.IP "fonts/bdf/"
.br
This directory contains the source for 120 fonts.  Unfortunately, there are
no coherent families yet (this is where the gftobdf converter will be quite
handy).  BDF stands for ``Bitmap Distribution Format'' and is an extension
of the Adobe Inc. standard ASCII format for font distribution.  You can buy
fonts from Adobe in a format very similar to this, although make sure that you
order both the bitmap and metric files.  See the document \fIdoc/bdf.ps\fP 
for a description of the BDF encoding.
.IP "fonts/compiler/"
.br
This directory contains the source for the BDF to server natural format
font compiler.  This program can be configured to produce fonts for a 
variety of different server architectures.  
.IP "fonts/snf/"
.br
This directory contains the compiled version of the fonts.  SNF stands for
Server Natural Format and is the representation that the sample server uses.
It is important to note that although most servers will probably accept the
SNF format, there is no requirement that they do so.
.IP "lib/"
.br
This directory contains all of the major libraries in the standard
distribution. 
.IP "lib/CLX/"
.br
This directory contains the CLX Common Lisp X package.  This is a native
Common Lisp interface to the X protocol (i.e. it doesn't use Xlib) that 
will be under review 
by the X Consortium for possible inclusion in the X standard.
.IP "lib/X/"
.br
This directory contains the Xlib C language programming library.  
The interface provided by this package
is part of the X standard (i.e. any vendor that ships any C interface
must ship Xlib in order to call its product X).  Vendors are free to change
the internals, but the interface must remain the same.  There
have been a number of fixes made to the image manipulation routines, and the
event checking routines have been changed to flush the output buffer only
when blocking.  No changes to client code should be necessary.  However due
to changes in several of the major data structures, all programs should be
recompiled before being linked with the new library.
.IP "lib/X/hp/"
.br
This directory contains routines for making Xlib work on Hewlett-Packard
computers and are generally useful for System V machines.
.IP "lib/Xaw/"
.br
This directory contains the Athena widget set.  It is the beginning of
a growing collection of user interface objects built on top of the X Toolkit
Intrinsics.  Widgets are used in building higher-level applications, and should
ideally provide as much mechanism and as little policy as possible (that is 
for user interface toolkits, user interface management systems, and
applications to implement).
.IP "lib/Xt/"
.br
This directory contains a sample implementation of the X Toolkit Intrinsics,
a collection of resource, event, and object managers that provide a mechanism 
for building user interfaces objects called \fIwidgets\fP.
.IP "lib/oldX/"
.br
This directory contains X11 implementations of the X10 \fIXDraw\fP (including
spline support) and \fIAssocTable\fP routines.
.IP "server/"
.br
This directory contains a sample server for the core protocol.  It should
match the X Protocol Specification fairly closely, but the Specification is
the final authority.  Read the documentation in the \fIdoc/Server\fP 
directory, any README files in the \fIserver/ddx/\fP directories, 
and study the code very hard before trying to make any changes.
.IP "server/ddx/"
.br
This directory contains the device dependant libraries for a number of
different platforms.  Study any README files before 
building or installing any servers.
.IP "server/ddx/apollo/"
.br
This directory contains full sources for building a server that runs on
monochrome and color Apollo displays.  The README file gives hints and
prerequisites for building this server.
.IP "server/ddx/cfb/"
.br
This directory contains a sample ``color frame buffer'' library for getting
color ports off the ground.  After a server is running, it should then be 
optimized to use any available hardware support.  
The cfb code is very slow, but very portable.
.IP "server/ddx/dec/"
.br
This directory contains full sources for building servers for both the 
monochrome QVSS and the color QDSS displays.  It also has routines for
manipulating LK201 keyboards.
.IP "server/ddx/hp/"
.br
This directory contains full sources for building a server that runs on 
the HP 9000/300 series (310, 320, 330, and 350) workstations with the
98547A, 985475A, and 98544A color and monochrome displays.  This is the
first publicly available port based on System V.
.IP "server/ddx/ibm/"
.br
This directory contains sources for building a server that runs on the
AED, APA16, APA19, EGA, Megapel, 8514 and VGA displays under IBM 4.3bsd
(i.e. not under AIX).
.IP "server/ddx/mfb/"
.br
This directory contains a sample ``monochrome frame buffer'' library for 
getting monochrome ports off the ground.  If hardware support is available,
it should be used wherever possible once a server is running.  
The mfb code gets respectable performance and is very portable.
.IP "server/ddx/mi/"
.br
This directory contains a machine independent implementation of the various
graphics operations.  It is frequently used with the mfb and cfb libraries in
porting the server to new platforms and in manipulating in-memory pixmaps.
It is designed to be very portable.
.IP "server/ddx/snf/"
.br
This directory contains the routines for manipulating SNF fonts.
Most servers use the SNF out of convenience, but there
is no requirement that they do so.
.IP "server/ddx/sun/"
.br
This directory contains full sources for building a server that runs on 
Sun bw2 and various cg displays.  It uses the cfb library instead of a lot of 
device specific routines and is therefore somewhat slower than some of 
the other color servers in the supported distribution.  See the README file
in this directory before building or installing the Sun server.
.IP "server/dix/"
.br
This directory contains the device independent portions of the sample X server.
It is highly recommended that you not change any code in this directory as it
will prevent you from upgrading to new versions.  If you find problems or have
a proposal for a change that would making porting to new platforms easier,
fill out a copy of the form \fIdoc/bugs/bug-report\fP and send it to
\fIxbugs@expo.lcs.mit.edu\fP.
.IP "server/include/"
.br
This directory contains header files that are used throughout the server.
.IP "server/os/"
.br
This directory contains the various operating system dependent portions of 
the server.
.IP "server/os/4.2bsd/"
.br
This directory contains the routines needed to make the sample server run
under operating systems derived from 4.2bsd.
.IP "server/os/hpux/"
.br
This directory contains the routines needed to make the sample server run
under HP-UX 6.01.  This is the first implementation based on System V 
that is publicly available.  It uses sockets, though, not streams.
.IP "server/os/sysV/"
.br
It is hoped that this directory will one day contain the routines needed to
make the sample server run under generic System V.  Contributions will be
gladly accepted.
.IP "util/"
.br
This directory contains various programs and scripts for building 
and configuring the release.  The programs in this section should be the 
first ported when bringing up X on a new platform.
.IP "util/bm-convert/"
.br
The directory contains a filter for converting X10 format bitmap file to
X11 format (see \fIbitmap(1)\fP for additional information).
.IP "util/dist.clean/"
.br
This directory contains scripts for cleaning out the source tree before 
doing distributions.
.IP "util/imake/"
.br
This directory contains the most important build utility.  The \fIimake\fP
program is used to generate the appropriate machine dependent Makefiles from
machine independent descriptions called Imakefiles.  It uses the C preprocessor
so that symbolic names and macro functions may be defined.  It has its own
handcrafted Makefile, and a special program for determining the initial
compilation flags.  If you are porting the release to a new machine,
you may need to edit \fIutil/imake/ccflags.c\fP to add any compiler flags that 
your machine will need when compiling \fIimake\fP.  \fIImake\fP will be built
automatically as part of ``make World.''
.IP "util/imake.includes/"
.br
This somewhat obscure directory contains the configuration files 
that \fImake\fP uses in generating the various Makefiles in the release.  
Before doing ``make World,'' check the \fIutil/imake.includes/Imake.tmpl\fP
and \fIutil/imake.includes/\fBmachine\fI\.macros\fR files to make sure that
they are properly set up for your machine.  If you are porting X to a new
machine, study these files carefully.
.IP "util/makedepend/"
.br
This directory contains a program for automatically generating dependencies
for Makefiles.  It is used as part of the build process to ensure that the 
right files are recompiled whenever any source files are changed.  If the 
configuration
parameter CppSourcesPresent is defined in the appropriate
\fIutil/imake.includes/\fBmachine\fI\.macros\fR file, \fImakedepend\fP will
have a copy of the C preprocessor built into it for speed.  This is not 
necessary and is not done in this release.  \fIMakedepend\fP is built
automatically as part of the ``make World'' phase.
.IP "util/patch/"
.br
This directory contain's Larry Wall's \fIpatch\fP program, an extraordinarily
useful program for patching diffs into source code.  This program is not
built automatically in this release; it is provided simply for
the convenience of people who do not have access to the comp.sources.unix
archives.
.IP "util/rgb/"
.br
This directory contains a sample RGB color database and a program to compile
it.  A better database is sorely needed, but nobody has volunteered one yet.
This release adds gray, grey, brown, and case insensitivity.  You
should recompile and reinstall a new rgb database.

This directory contains a more recent version of the gnuplot interactive
plotting package.
.IP "contrib/kterm/"
.br
This directory contains a version of \fIxterm\fP that supports Kanji fonts.
The non-Kanji sections should correspond fairly closely to the sources found 
in \fIclients/xterm/\fP.  A public domain Kanji font has been added to 
\fIfonts/bdf/\fP in the supported distribution.  However, some servers don't 
implement 16 bit fonts correctly.
.IP "contrib/menus/"
.br
This directory contains a sample menu widget.
.IP "contrib/oldXMenu/"
