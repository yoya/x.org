What's New in this Release
.LP
This release differs from the previous one in the following areas:
.\".ll -5
.\".in +5
.IP "X now has an official name"
.br
The X Consortium has designated the following as the official names of the
X Window System:
.sp
.ce 5
X
X Window System
X Version 11
X Window System, Version 11
X11
.sp
Note that the phrases X.11, X-11, X Windows or any permutation thereof, are
explicitly excluded from this list and should not be used to describe the
X Window System (window system should be thought of as one word).  In addition,
\fIX Window System\fP is a trademark of MIT and should be acknowledged
as such whenever it is used.
.IP "many, many bugs fixed"
.br
A large number of bugs have been fixed in the server, the libraries, 
and the
clients.  Many parts of the sample server that were broken in 
in the previous release have been
fixed, and client workarounds for old bugs have been removed; old servers
may not work properly with new clients.
Many of the byte order problems have
been fixed; this release should work equally well on both big endian and 
little endian architectures.
.IP "new servers"
.br
Native ddx source code has been contributed for the following servers:
Apollo's monochrome and color displays; Digital's QDSS display;
Hewlett-Packard's 9000/series 300 machines 
(310, 320, 330, and 350) with the 98547A, 98545A, and 98544A displays; and
IBM's EGA, Megapel, 8514, and VGA displays.  All of these server 
implementations use special display hardware to gain good performance.
.IP "compressed fonts"
.br
Many servers now do automatic uncompression of fonts that are stored in
\fIcompress(1)\fP format.  This can save a substantial amount of disk space
for seldomly used fonts.  
.IP "Xrm merged into Xlib"
.br
The Resource Manager has been merged into Xlib and is now used by the
\fIXGetDefault\fP routine and the X Toolkit.  This means that 
defaults stored in the server using the \fIxrdb(1)\fP program are now honored
by all programs.  There is also a new environment variable called
XENVIRONMENT, that specifies the name of an additional resource file to 
be merged in on top of the server defaults and any application defaults.
The format for specifying resources has changed slightly to allow wildcarding
within resource hierarchies (i.e. ``program*name: value'').  See the Xlib
documentation on using the Resource Manager for more details.
.IP "X Toolkit Specification and implementation"
.br
The X Toolkit Specification and a sample implementation are included in this
release.  The X Toolkit provides a collection of resource, event, and 
object managers upon which user interface objects called \fIwidgets\fP are
built.  This specification is currently under review by the X Consortium
for possible inclusion in the X standard.  The beginnings of an Athena
widget set are also provided.
.IP "new -display and -geometry command line arguments"
.br
All supported clients have been changed to require a ``-display'' argument
in command line specifications of the X server to use.  Programs in 
previous releases mistakenly assumed that any command line argument that
contained a colon (:) was a display name.  This caused severe problems for
sites with distributed file systems and for the new ``-xrm'' command line
option in all X Toolkit clients.  Similarly, the old ``=geom'' is being
replaced by ``-geometry geom''.  \fBAll programs should accept
-display and -geometry.\fP  Unambiguous abbreviations are allowed so long
as the full name may also be given.
.IP "fewer flushes in Xlib"
.br
The Xlib event checking routines 
\fIXNextEvent\fP,
\fIXPeekEvent\fP,
\fIXIfEvent\fP,
\fIXCheckIfEvent\fP,
\fIXPeekIfEvent\fP,
\fIXWindowEvent\fP,
\fIXCheckWindowEvent\fP,
\fIXMaskEvent\fP,
\fIXCheckMaskEvent\fP,
\fIXCheckTypedEvent\fP,
\fIXCheckTypedWindowEvent\fP, and
\fIXPendingEvent\fP
have been changed to only flush the output buffer when they are about to 
block, instead
of doing a flush on every call.  This modification is compatible with the 
previous release and should not require any client code changes.  Applications
that do a lot of event checking will notice an increase in performance.
.IP "new send_event flag in Xlib XEvents"
.br
Events originating from another client using the \fIXSendEvent\fP routine
no longer have the eighth bit of the event type set.  Instead, a new 
``send_event'' flag has been added to the various event structures.  Because
of this, \fBall clients should be recompiled before being linked with the new 
library.\fP
.IP "padding added to Xlib XEvents"
.br
To provide room in the event structures for extensions, a small amount of 
padding has been added to all events.  Although no client
code changes are necessary, \fBall programs should be recompiled before being
linked with the new library.\fP
.IP "serial number tracking in Xlib"
.br
Support for tracking serial numbers of requests has been added.  The
protocol provides this information, but the previous release of the library
discarded it.  Two new macros \fINextRequest\fP and
\fILastKnownRequestProcessed\fP (and corresponding routines) have been added
to return the serial number of the next request and the serial number of
the last request known to have been executed by the server.
.IP "new XEventsQueued routine in Xlib"
.br
A new routine, \fIXEventsQueued\fP, has been added to bring together the 
functionality of \fIXQLength\fP and \fIXPending\fP (i.e. they have been 
rewritten to use the new routine) and to add the ability to
do a ``non-flushing \fIXPending\fP.''  New clients
should use \fIXEventsQueued\fP instead of the old routines.
.IP "new XCreatePixmapFromBitmapData routine in Xlib"
.br
A new routine, \fIXCreatePixmapFromBitmapData\fP, has been added to create
pixmaps of arbitrary depths given \fIbitmap(1)\fP format data.  This should be
used to create tiles (for backgrounds and borders) rather than
\fIXCreateBitmapFromData\fP (which creates masks for defining clipping 
regions, cursor shapes, icon shapes, and stipple patterns).
.IP "misdeclared types fixed in Xlib
.br
A number of width, height, and byte count arguments that should have been 
declared unsigned, but were not, have been fixed.
.IP "new XUnionRectWithRegion to Xlib"
.br
A new routine, \fIXUnionRectWithRegion\fP, has been added to merge a rectangle
with a region.  This is useful for implementing exposure compression.
.IP "XPutImage, XPutPixel and XGetPixel fixed in Xlib"
.br
The Xlib routines \fIXPutImage\fP, \fIXPutPixel\fP and \fIXGetPixel\fP 
have had many bugs fixed.
.IP "new X10 to X11 protocol translator"
.br
A client that masquerades as an X10 server but which uses X11 for input
and output is now available.  It allows
X10 programs to run, unmodified, on X11 displays and should make changing
over from X10 to X11 much easier.
.IP "reimplementations of old clients"
.br
The \fIxrdb\fP and \fIxmodmap\fP clients have been rewritten to provide 
a substantial number of new features.  The new \fIxrdb\fP can use the
C preprocessor to selectively load resources, merge in new
resources, and edit current defaults into resource files.  The new
\fIxmodmap\fP reads description files that allow you to remap keys on the
keyboard as well as redefine modifier keys.  Both programs support the syntax
of the versions in the previous release (except for the new -display 
requirements).
.IP "new clients"
.br
Two new programs, \fIxlogo\fP and \fIxbiff\fP, have been added to the
supported distribution.  These programs use the Logo and Mailbox widgets
from the Athena widget set:  \fIxlogo\fP displays the X Window System logo, and
\fIxbiff\fP provides a little mailbox that pops up when you have mail.
.IP "old X Toolkit removed"
.br
All of the clients that used the old versions of the X Toolkit now use the
version available in this release.  Therefore, libXtk and liboldXtk have been
dropped from this release.
.IP "new InterViews toolkit"
.br
Source code and documentation for a
new version of the InterViews toolkit from Stanford University are available
in the user-contributed distribution.

in the user-contributed distribution.
.IP "Cray patches"
.br
A collection of patches to make the version of Xlib distributed in the previous
release work on a CRAY-XMP or CRAY-2 under UNICOS is available in the 
user-contributed distribution.  Support for these platforms will be integrated
in the next release.
.IP "MetaFont GF to X BDF converter"
.br
A filter for generating X BDF font files from MetaFont GF descriptions is
available in the user-contributed distribution.
.IP "new gnuplot"
.br
A new version of the gnuplot package is available in the user-contributed

.br
A version of \fIxterm\fP that supports kanji is available in the
user-contributed distribution.  A public domain Kanji font has also been
added to \fIfonts/bdf/\fP.
.IP "XMenu no longer supported"
.br
The XMenu package is obsolete and will no longer be supported.  It has been
moved to the user-contributed distribution and will be dropped from future
releases.
.IP "Portable Bitmap Toolkit"
.br
