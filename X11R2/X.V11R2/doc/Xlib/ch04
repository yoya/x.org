\*(SN Obtaining Window Information 
.XE
.LP
Xlib provides functions with which you can obtain information about the window
tree, the current attributes of a window, 
its current geometry, or the current pointer
coordinates.
Because they are most frequently used by window managers,
these functions all return a status to indicate whether the window still
exists.

Properties and Atoms

\*(SN Properties and Atoms 
.XE
.LP
A property is a collection of named typed data.
Data of only one type may be associated with a single
property.  
Clients can store and retrieve properties associated with windows.
For efficiency reasons,
an atoms is used rather than a whole name string.
.PN XInternAtom
can be used either to define new properties or to obtain the atom 
for new properties.
.IN "Atom" 
.LP
The window system has a set of predefined properties
.IN "Atom" "Predefined properties"
(for example, the name of a window, size hints, and so on), and users can
define any other arbitrary information
and can associate them with windows.
Each property has a name,
which is an ISO Latin-1 string.
For each named property
there is a unique identifier (atom) associated
with it. 
A property also has a type, for example, string or integer.
These types are also indicated using atoms, so arbitrary new
types can be defined.
.LP
A property is also stored in one of several possible formats.
The X server can store the information as 8-bit quantities, 16-bit
quantities, or 32-bit quantities.
This permits the X server to present the data in the byte order that the
client expects.
.NT
If you define further properties of complex type, 
you must encode and decode them yourself.
These functions must be carefully written if they are to be portable.
See Appendix D for further information about how to write a library function.
.NE
The type of a property is defined by other properties, which allows for
arbitrary extension in this type scheme.
.IN "Atom" "" "@DEF@"
.LP
Certain properties are
predefined in the server for commonly used functions.
The atoms for these properties are defined in 
.Pn < X11/Xatom.h >.
To avoid name clashes with user symbols, the 
.PN #define 
name for each atom has the ``XA_'' prefix added.
See Section 4.3 for definitions of these properties.
See Chapter 9 for an explanation of the functions that let
you get and set
much of the information 
stored in these predefined properties.
.LP
You can use this mechanism to communicate other information between
applications.
The functions described in this section let you define new properties and get the
unique Atom IDs in your applications.

.XE
.LP
.IN "Selection" "" "@DEF@"
Selections are one method for applications to exchange data.
By using the property mechanism,
applications can exchange data of arbitrary types and can negotiate
the type of the data.
A selection can be thought of as an indirect property with a dynamic type.
That is, rather than having the property stored in the X server,
the property is maintained by some client (the owner).
A selection is global
in nature, being thought of as belonging to the user but maintained by
clients, rather than being private to a particular window subhierarchy
or a particular set of clients.
.LP
Xlib provides functions with which you can set, get, or request conversion
of window selections.
This allows applications to implement the notion of current selection,
which requires notification be sent to applications when they no longer
own the selection.
Applications that support selection often highlight the current selection
and need to be able to be informed when some other application has
acquired the selection in order to be able to unhighlight the
selection.
.LP
When a client asks for the contents of
a selection, it specifies a selection target type.
This target type
can be used to control the transmitted representation of the contents.
For example, if the selection is ``the last thing the user clicked on,''
and that is currently an image, then the target type might specify
whether the contents of the image should be sent in XYFormat or
ZFormat.
.LP
The target type can also be used to control the class of
contents transmitted, for example, 
asking for the ``looks'' (fonts, line
spacing, indentation, and so forth) of a paragraph selection, not the
text of the paragraph.
The target type can also be used for other
purposes.
The semantics are not constrained by the protocol.
.LP
.sp
To set the selection owner, use 
.PN XSetSelectionOwner .
.IN "Selection" "Setting the owner"
.IN "XSetSelectionOwner" "" "@DEF@"
.FD 0
.so ./Xsrc/XSetSelOwner.f
.FN
.so ./Xsrc/display.a
.so ./Xsrc/selection.a
.so ./Xsrc/owner.a
.so ./Xsrc/time.a
.LP
.so ./Xdescrip/XSetSelOwner.d
The function has no effect if
the value you pass to the time argument is earlier than the current 
last-change time
of the specified selection or is later than the current X server time.
Otherwise, the last-change time is set to the specified time,
with
.PN CurrentTime
replaced by the current server time.
If the owner window is specified as
.PN None ,
then the owner of the selection becomes None (that is, no owner).
Otherwise, the owner of the selection becomes the client executing
the request.
.LP 
If the new owner (whether a client or
.PN None )
is not
the same as the current owner of the selection, and the current
owner is not
.PN None ,
the current owner is sent a 
.PN SelectionClear 
event.
If the client that is the owner of a selection is later
terminated (that is, its connection is closed)
or if the owner window it has specified in the request is later
destroyed,
the owner of the selection automatically
reverts to
.PN None ,
but the last-change time is not affected.
The selection atom is uninterpreted by the X server.
The owner window is returned by the 
.IN XGetSelectionOwner
.PN XGetSelectionOwner
function and is reported
in 
.PN SelectionRequest
and
.PN SelectionClear
events.
Selections are global to the X server.
.LP
.ds fd .PN XSetSelectionOwner
.so ./Xsrc/errsent.com
.PN BadAtom
and
.PN BadWindow 
errors.
.LP
.sp
To return selection owner, use 
.PN XGetSelectionOwner .
.IN "Selection" "Getting the owner"
.IN "XGetSelectionOwner" "" "@DEF@"
.FD 0
.so ./Xsrc/XGetSelOwner.f
.FN
.so ./Xsrc/display.a
.so ./Xsrc/selection.a
This is the atom whose owner you want returned.
.LP
.so ./Xdescrip/XGetSelOwner.d
If
.PN None
is returned,
there is no owner for the selection.
.LP
.ds fd .PN XGetSelectionOwner
.so ./Xsrc/errsent4.com
.PN BadAtom 
error.
.LP
.sp
To request conversion of a selection, use 
.PN XConvertSelection .
.IN "Selection" "Converting"
.IN "XConvertSelection" "" "@DEF@"
.FD 0
.so ./Xsrc/XConvertSel.f
.FN
.so ./Xsrc/display.a
.so ./Xsrc/selection.a
.so ./Xsrc/target.a
.so ./Xsrc/property.a
You also can pass 
.PN None .
.so ./Xsrc/requestor.a
.so ./Xsrc/time.a
.LP
.so ./Xdescrip/XConvertSel.d
.LP
There are two predefined selection atoms: ``PRIMARY'' and ``SECONDARY''.
See Chapter 8
for more information on events, and in particular the
.PN SelectionNotify
event.
