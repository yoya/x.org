Thanks also to DARPA, for supporting the research side of the X protocol.

Our undying gratitude to Todd Brunhoff (and to Tektronix for sending him);
Todd performed wonders in making the alpha and beta tests happen, filtering
bug reports, integrating sources from everywhere, putting the releases
and updates together, and generally hacking up a storm.

Infinite thanks to Ken Goldman, MIT, for accepting thousands of phone
calls, mail messages, being patient, sending out documentation, and
generally keeping us insulated from the outside world.

The people who made it happen, either with code or documentation; so
many of these people worked on more than one major component of the
system (toolkits, libraries, applications, servers) that we have not
attempted to list people by component:
