Whereas the design and implementation of the first 10 versions of X
were primarily the work of three individuals, Robert Scheifler of the
M.I.T.  Laboratory for Computer Science and Jim Gettys of Digital
Equipment Corporation and Ron Newman of M.I.T., both working at
Project Athena, X version 11 is the result of the efforts of literally
dozens of individuals at almost as many locations and organizations.
At the risk of offending some of the players by exclusion, several
people deserve special credit and recognition.

the release would never have materialized):

Thanks also to DARPA, for supporting the research side of the X protocol.
.LP
Our undying gratitude to Todd Brunhoff (and to Tektronix for sending him);
Todd performed wonders in making the alpha and beta tests happen, filtering
bug reports, integrating sources from everywhere, putting the releases
and updates together, and generally hacking up a storm.
.LP
Infinite thanks to Ken Goldman, MIT, for accepting thousands of phone
calls, mail messages, being patient, sending out documentation, and
generally keeping us insulated from the outside world.
.LP
Great appreciation goes to
Phil Karlton
and Scott McGregor, both of DEC, for their considerable contributions
to the specification of the version 11 protocol.
Also Sue Angebranndt, Raymond
Drewry and Todd Newman of DEC's Western Software Laboratory, with
Phil, have worked long and hard to produce the sample server
implementation.
.LP
Special thanks must also go to Sam Fuller, Vice President of Research at
DEC, who has remained committed to the widest public availability of X and
who foresaw a year ago the need to greatly supplement Project Athena's
resources with the WSL staff in order to make version 11 a reality.
.LP
Many thanks from us and the several vendors who have
a head start on porting X11 to their color frambuffers
goes to
Dave Rosenthal of
Sun Microsystems.
He provided the
sample generic color frame buffer ddx code and
also contributed to the protocol.
.LP
Many other people made it happen, either with code or documentation; so
many of these people worked on more than one major component of the
system (toolkits, libraries, applications, servers) that we have not
attempted to list people by component:

Thanks to the alpha and beta sites, who contributed much in the way of
bug reports and fixes.
.LP
Thanks to the MIT Statistics Center, for the use of their Suns and for
putting up with us.
