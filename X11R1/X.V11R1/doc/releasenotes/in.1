X Window System version 11 is
a network transparent window system developed at MIT and is intended to
be able to support virtually all known instances of raster display hardware.
This document is a collection of notes on the system's installation and
use.

Overview
.LP
Welcome to the first release of version 11 of The X Window System.
This release represents a major redesign and enhancement of X and signals
its graduation from the research community into the product engineering
and development community.  The X Window System version 11 is intended to
be able to support virtually all known instances of raster display
hardware and reasonable future hardware, including hardware supporting
deep frame buffers, multiple colormaps and various levels of hardware
graphics assist.
.LP
A note about terminology is in order here.  First, the document "X Window
System Protocol, Version 11" is the definitive description of what is (and
what is not) part of the core X Window System.  This is distinct from the
sample server implementation that forms the foundation of this release.
The sample server is provided here for the benefit of developers who wish
to quickly produce an implementation for a new piece of hardware.  The
sample server is not necessarily intended to be a reference
implementation, although that remains a possibility for the future.
Instead, it is
our intention that future implementors
will be able to rely on the protocol
specification and related documents and not be forced to refer
to the code.  The sample server, with device-dependent and device-independent
implementations as
contributed from various places, will remain the foundation of the M.I.T.
X Window System distribution.
.LP
The C language interface defined by Xlib is only one of many possible
language bindings to the protocol.  While we certainly encourage
standardization of the Xlib interface (and at least one international
standards organization is considering this), we are not dogmatic on this
point.  Xlib has two somewhat conflicting requirements; first, it is the
lowest level procedural interface to the X protocol.  As such, it must
implement all the nuances possible without encroaching on the vendors' and
application developers' prerogative to set conventions for style.  Xlib's
second mission is to be the first level interface for applications
development, in anticipation of future work (such as the toolkit) on
common higher-level applications interfaces.  In fulfillment of this
objective, Xlib includes many "convenience routines" that are a
re-packaging of one or more protocol operations to simplify common cases,
and it includes several additional utility routines that have no direct
relationship to the protocol but that are required when building "real"
applications, such as window managers.
.LP
The toolkit is a 'beta test' release.  The design here should look
familiar to those of you who used our early prototypes under version
10, but we have changed most of the interfaces in ways that we hope
make the task of writing widgets much easier to accomplish.  The
earlier prototype toolkit is included on the tape for those of you who need it
to assist your conversion.  You should not expect it to appear on the
next release.
.LP
The clients provided on this release should not be construed as
the correct way for them to be written,
but should be regarded as what most of them really are:
straight-forward ports of existing X version 10 clients.
Only a few use the toolkit and only the old version at that.
Those of you
who used previous versions of X will find several differences
in their input, output and options, not all
of them documented.  Some of the differences are intentional and some
not.  Feel free to let us know if you really think something is
broken, but we will also feel free to respond with an alternative to
your proposal.
.LP
By default, X is distributed to install on a stock 4.3BSD system;
installation under Ultrix-32 release 2.0 should essentially be the same.
It has been known to compile and run on ATT System V systems
but we haven't had access to such a system to verify this.
