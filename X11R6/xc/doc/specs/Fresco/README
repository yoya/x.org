This directory contains FrameMaker sources for documentation on the Fresco
user interface system.  The sources here are used to build two different
documents:

  spec.mf	A FrameMaker book file that generates version 0.7
		of the the Fresco working group's draft specification.
		It is important to understand that this document is 
		only a working draft, not a Consortium standard.

  firm.mf	A FrameMaker book file that generates the Sample
		Implementation Reference Manual for version 0.7 of
		the Fresco sample implementation.  The Fresco SI
		implments everything in version 0.7 of the working
		draft specification, plus many other objects and
		interfaces that may or may not become standards in
		the future.
