<sect> Information for W32 Chipset Users <p>
<tt>XF86_W32</tt> is basically <tt>XF86_SVGA</tt> with the drawing code
completely replaced with one based on X11R6's <tt>mi/cfb</tt> code and
modified for the ET4000/W32 series.  Even
though it accepts the same keywords as <tt>XF86_SVGA</tt>,
those not applicable to the ET4000/W32 series are silently ignored;
e.g., the keyword "SpeedUp" is a no-op.
The server currently supports the w32, w32i, and w32p chips.  For
a complete list, see the sign-on message printed by <tt>XF86_W32</tt>.
The server supports only 8bpp operation at present.

Just as with <tt>XF86_SVGA</tt>, you can specify a virtual world that has
a width that is a multiple of four.
The size of the virtual world is constrained by the
amount of the available video RAM.  <tt>XF86_W32</tt> can use more
than 1 M of video RAM, but it reserves 1 K for internal use.
If you have 1 M, <tt>XF86_W32</tt> will
say you have 1023 K, and you get to specify the virtual world as 1152x900,
but not 1152x910.

The current maximum clock is set to 86 MHz, because this is what the Tseng
databooks say.

If you have problems with the server.  Try the following things:
<itemize>
<item>  Take out the Hercules monochrome adapter, if you have one.  Many 
    configurations of the ET4000/W32 series do not allow one in the
    system.
<item> Get a motherboard with its local bus running at 33 MHz.  Many, if not
    all, ET4000/W32 boards will surely behave in a funny way on a 50-MHz
    bus.  You may have to use a wait state or two, but first try without
    any.
</itemize>
Note that the built-in power saver (for a "green" monitor) has not been
tested.  Also do not expect it to work on a board without a w32p_rev_c or
later chip.

<sect> Acknowledgments <p>
Jerry J. Shekhel (<it>jerry@msi.com</it>) gave me the 1-M Mirage
ET4000/W32 VLB board on which the initial development (X_W32) was done.

X11R6 and the XFree86 Project provide the base code for XF86_W32. 

Hercules Computer Technology Inc. lent me a 2-M Hercules Dynamite Pro VLB
board for the development that led to <tt>XF86_W32</tt>. 

Numerous testers have given me feedback for <tt>X_W32</tt> and later
<tt>XF86_W32</tt>.  I
apologize for my failure to keep track of the people who tested
<tt>X_W32</tt>, but
the names of the people involved with the <tt>XF86_W32</tt> testing are
listed below:
