## delallar.pi -
## Test delete all structures from archive operation 
##
## Verify the structure identifiers in archive 
##
## Note: a->b means str a executes str b, ae means struct a is empty,
##       a' means this str a has same name as str a, but different contents
##
## setup in archive:
## 	0->1->2  3
## operations: 
##	delete all archived strs 
## expected results in archive:
##	NULL
