## buildtran.pi -
## Test matrix utility functions pbuild_tran_matrix, pbuild_tran_matrix3
## Test using different 
##   reference points: origin,non-origin
##   tranlation vectors: some values
##   scaling vectors: some values
##   rotation angles: some values
## The resulting matrix from the utility is compared to the matrix 
## from the same operation performed in the test code.
