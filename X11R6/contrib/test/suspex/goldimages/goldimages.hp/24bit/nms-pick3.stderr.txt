Notes:
	 Namset 1 contains a red polyline.
	 Namset 2 contains a green polyline.
	 Namset 3 contains a blue polyline.
	 Expected ouput will be of the form:
		Initial incl=<included sets>, excl=<excluded sets>,exxpected number of picks
		Changed incl=<included sets>, excl=<excluded sets>, expected number of picks, total number of picks

Image 1:
		Initial incl=NULL, excl=NULL, expecting NO picks
		Changed incl=NULL, excl=NULL, expecting NO picks, total of NO picks
	Picked NO primitives.
Image 2:
		Initial incl=[1], excl=NULL, expecting 1 pick,
		Changed incl=[1,3], excl=NULL, expecting 2 picks, total of 3 picks
	Picked 3 primitives.
Image 3:
		Initial incl=[1,2,3], excl=NULL, expecting 3 picks
		Changed incl=NULL, excl=NULL, expecting NO picks, total of 3 picks
	Picked 3 primitives.
Image 4:
		Initial incl=[1,3], excl=[2], expecting 2 picks
		Changed incl=[1,3], excl=[2,3], expecting 1 pick, total of 3 picks
	Picked 3 primitives.
Image 5:
		Initial incl=[1,2,3], excl=[1,2,3], expecting NO picks
		Changed incl=[1,2,3], excl=NULL, expecting 3 picks, total of 3 picks
	Picked 3 primitives.
