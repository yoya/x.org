Notes:
	 Namset 1 contains a red polyline (top).
	 Namset 2 contains a green polyline (middle).
	 Namset 3 contains a blue polyline (bottom).
	 Expected ouput will be of the form:
		incl=<included sets>, excl=<excluded sets>, number of picks

Image 1:
		incl=NULL, excl=NULL, expecting NO picks
	Picked NO primitives.
Image 2:
		incl=[1], excl=NULL, expecting 1 pick
	Picked 1 primitives.
Image 3:
		incl=[1,2,3], excl=NULL, expecting 3 picks
	Picked 3 primitives.
Image 4:
		incl=[1,3], excl=[2], expecting 2 picks
	Picked 2 primitives.
Image 5:
		incl=[1,2,3], excl=[1],  expecting 2 picks
	Picked 2 primitives.
Image 6:
		incl=[1,2,3], excl=[1,2,3],  expecting NO picks
	Picked NO primitives.
Image 7:
		incl=NUL, excl=[1,2,3],  expecting NO picks
	Picked NO primitives.
Image 8:
		incl=[1,2,3], excl=NULL,  expecting 3 picks
	Picked 3 primitives.
Image 9:
		incl=NULL, excl=NULL,  expecting NO picks
	Picked NO primitives.
