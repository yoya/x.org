This distribution contains XTrap for X11R6, sample clients, and the
Xhydra utility.  This distribution is based on the following pieces
of the X11R5 contrib collection:
	XTrapV33_X11R5.tar.Z	- the R5 distribution of XTrap
	XTrap_GrabPatch		- enhancement for less-intrusive grab fix
	XTrap_SleepPatch	- bug fix for XTrap library sleep time
	XTrapClients-3.3.tar.Z	- an update to the xtrap clients
	XTrapV32_DOC.tar.Z	- architecture specifications for XTrap v3.2

XTrap is an extension to X that facilitates user emulation.  Device input
synthesis, device input monitoring, and grapics request output monitoring
are supported by XTrap.  XTrap's official name is DEC-XTRAP.

XTrap comes with a client-side library which makes the new functionality
easier to use in an X application.  XTrap also comes with sample clients
which demonstrate the various capabilities of the extension and library.
Please see the man page within programs/xtrap/xtrap.man for more information.

Xhydra is a utility to assemble multiple X workstations into a poor man's 
multi-headed workstation.  A user at a single workstation's keyboard and
mouse can interface with clients displaying on multiple X displays.  Please
see the man page within programs/xhydra/xhydra.man for more information.
Xhydra is new to this XTrap public release.

Notes on building:

A weakness in the packaging of this release of XTrap for X11R6 is
that although these files may reside in the contrib tree, it
is assumed that they will be compiled in the xc tree.  If there
is a next release, hopefully this will be improved.
