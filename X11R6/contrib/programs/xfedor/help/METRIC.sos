This mode is used for visualization of the bounding box of the character.
It allows you to position the approach of the character (HADJ) and
its increment (HINCR) with the mouse (MB1 and MB2).

HADJ is also use for positionning the mouse hot-spot x coordinate in the
case of a mouse creation. The mouse hot-spot y coordinate is given by
the baseline.

The increment HINCR depends onthe HADJ value...
