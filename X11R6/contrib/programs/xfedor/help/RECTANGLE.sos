This mode allows you to draw filled or unfilled rectangles.

As for the circle, MB1 gives unfilled and MB2 filled boxes.
You first have to choose the upper-left corner of the rectangle
with a mouse press and release only on the lower-right corner.

You can abort after the first press by leaving the edit window before
the releasing.
