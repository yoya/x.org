With this command, you can do cut-and-paste within a drawing.

You first have to select a rectangular box (as for the rectangle mode,
by a press on the upper-left and a release on the lower-right corner).
Then a shadowed rectangle follows the mouse until you press a second time
for specifying : with MB1 a copy, and with MB2 a move.

As for the others, leaving the edit window abort the drawing effect.
