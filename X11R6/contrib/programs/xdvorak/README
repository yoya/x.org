Xdvorak -- Dvorak keyboard layout for X.

This is README version 1.2 of 94/05/20.

USAGE

Xdvorak installs a Dvorak keyboard map with the command:

		xdvorak

With no arguments, the program toggles between a Dvorak and a qwerty
keyboard map.  Any arguments force the installation of a qwerty
keyboard map.  Execute "xdvorak -qwerty" when you log out.

INSTALLATION

There are no special installation instructions.

TESTING

The program was tested on a Sun4 running SunOS 4.1.3 and X11R6 with
fix01 applied on 20 May 1994.

HISTORY

The original program was distributed as contributed software in X11R3.
Jim Blandy donated some patches that allow it to work on servers with
a keymaps that were not anticipated.  He also rewrote some parts of
the code so as to make it easier to understand.  This version replaces
references to display structure components by a call to
XDisplayKeycodes.
