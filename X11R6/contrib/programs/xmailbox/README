The xmailbox++ program is, essentially, an enhanced xbiff. Both images for the
the "mail in mailbox" and "no mail" states are (potentially user-defined) XPM
type 3 files. The default images are, respectively, that of an empty mailbox
with its flag down, and that of an open mailbox, with its flag up and a letter
visible inside. It can also, optionally, play a sound through a workstation's
audio device, instead of generating the default beep sound, whenever new
mail arrives. Both the NCD audio server, the rplay sound package, and the 
standard SUN audio driver are supported. By default, pressing any mouse button 
in the image forces xmailbox++ to remember the current size of the mail file 
as being the "empty" size and to change its image accordingly. In addition to 
this, the user can optionally have xmailbox++ invoke his/her favourite mail 
retrieving program.

This program is nothing more than a wrapper around the Mailbox++ widget
included with the program's source distribution. Mailbox++ was derived by
the Mailbox widget included with the Athena Widget Set. The first version
of Mailbox++ was a hack based on the X11R5 Mailbox widget written by
Jim Fulton, MIT X Consortium, and Ralph Swick, DEC/MIT Project Athena. The
xmailbox++ source is practically identical to xbiff.

If you are planning to use the NCD Audio server or the rplay sound package, 
you can obtain these packages from ftp.x.org in /contrib/netaudio and 
/contrib/rplay respectively.  These packages provide network sound support.

To build xmailbox++:
 1. make any required changes in Imakefile, by specifying where the
    XPM includes and libs are, as well as the desired audio interface,
 2. run xmkmf and then make.

This program has been tested on Sun Sparc 2 & IPX under SunOS 4.1.3 and
HP 9000/710 under HP-UX 9.01.

NOTE: You'll need xpm-3.4 or higher in order to compile xmailbox++.
----  As of this writing, the latest version of xpm is 3.4; it can be
      obtained from ftp.x.org (in directory contrib, file xpm-3.4.tar.gz).

 Enjoy!
