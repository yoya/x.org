Xmandel is a user friendly interface for generating Mandelbrot sets and
Julia sets.  It initially comes up with with several command buttons,
which are described in the man page, for controlling the execution.  A
Mandelbrot set is drawn in the window of the initial form when the
mandel button is selected.  Other buttons are provided for zooming,
clearing, etc.  A separate window is created for drawing the Julia sets.

The software consists of the following source files:
	Imakefile
	README
	julia.c
	mandel.c
	xmandel.c
	xmandel.man

Xmandel will build on X11R5 and X11R6.  Included is an Imakefile, so to
build, you need only do:

	xmkmf 
	make

So far, xmandel has been tested on a Sun SPARC5 running SunOS 5.3, a
DEC 3000, and a Cray YMP, all displaying to the Sun.  I do not have
easy access to a depth 1 display for testing.  It will not work to
displays with depth other than 1 or 8, I will entertain fixes to make
it do so.
