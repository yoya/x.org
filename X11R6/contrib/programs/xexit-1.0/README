			README for Xexit
			----------------

Description:
------------
  The xexit program consists of a (small) window sitting somewhere on
your screen.  When clicking into it with the mouse pointer xexit tries
to gracefully terminate all clients of the current session.
  It first sends all clients participating in that protocol a WM_SAVE_YOURSELF
message. After that, a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message is sent.  All clients still
having windows, are now shut down with XKillClient().
  For convenience reasons xexit per default pops up a confirmation dialog
box.  This however can be suppressed either by commandline option or resource.
  Xexit is assumed to be the last client in the .xsession file and not be sent
in the background, though this is not strictly required.

Install Hints:
--------------
  There are two alternate bitmaps for xexit in bitmaps/haegar.
These are more "image-like" and were created by "Thomas 'TiCi' Thissen"
(tici@uni-paderborn.de). If you there instead of the "iconic-like" ones,
simply change in the last line of the Imakefile in InstallMultipleDestFlags()
BITMAPS1 to BITMAPS2.
