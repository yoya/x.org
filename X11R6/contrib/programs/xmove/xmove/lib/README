	Compiling the xmove library located in this directory is
only necessary if you wish to have xmove load its support
libraries dynamically. See README, xmove/README and
xmove/Imakefile for information on this decision.

	Included are two makefiles, Makefile.SunOS and
Makefile.Solaris. Makefile.SunOS has been tested with gcc in a
SunOS 4.1.x environment, using Sun's standard assembler and
linker (as and ld). Makefile.Solaris has been tested with
SunPro's cc in a Solaris 2.x environment.

	You may have to configure the files for your environment,
particularly the paths to the X11 includes and libraries. Also
note that, if you are using gcc, you must use Sun's assembler and
linker. Gnu does not support dynamic linking. Many systems are
already configured this way.

	If you are uncertain about your system's configuration
and its suitability for dynamic loading, either ask your system
administrator, or simply avoid the issue by using static linking
of xmove's library when building xmove. Also remember that this
is only an issue of how xmove loads its own support library,
libatommap. This does not affect how it links with the standard
libraries such as libc.
