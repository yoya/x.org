	Here is a list of a few of the features which we feel
make xmove stand out over other pseudoservers written to date:

* xmove provides support for the correct mapping of property and
selection information. Currently supported are ICCCM and
OpenLook, including Drag-and-Drop.  The support for properties
and selections is provided through dynamically loaded libraries,
allowing future enhancements, either by us or by others, simply
by dropping a library into a directory.

* xmove provides fairly sophisticated support for clients moved
to new server with different color availability. We successfully
moved IslandDraw from a color display to a grey-scale display to
a 1-bit monochrome display and back to the color display. We were
also able to move xv from a color display to a 1-bit display,
modify the color schemes, and have the modifications appear
correctly after moving the client back to the color display.

* Applications that open multiple connections to the server, such
as FrameMaker, are recognized and supported.

* Movement can be directed onto a specific screen of the new
display. This implies that movement between screens on the same
server is also possible.

* xmove is the first example of a pseudoerver designed
exclusively for client mobility and as such provides a better
starting point for continued development than was previously
available.
