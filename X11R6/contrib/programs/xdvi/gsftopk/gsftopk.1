.TH GSFTOPK 1 "20 Feb 1994"
.SH NAME
gsftopk \- render a ghostscript font in TeX pk format
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgsftopk\fP [\fB\-q\fP] \fIfont\fP \fIdpi\fP
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIfont\fP \w'\fIfont\fP'u+2m
Name of the font to be created.
.IP \fIdpi\fP
Desired resolution of the font to be created, in dots per inch.  This may
be a real number.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B gsftopk
is a program which calls up the ghostscript program
.BR gs (1)
to render a given font at a given resolution.  It packs the resulting
characters into the
.B pk
file format and writes them to a file whose name is formed from the font
name and the resolution (rounded to the nearest integer).
.PP
This program should normally be called by a script, such as
.BR xdvimakepk ,
to create fonts on demand.
.PP
.B gsftopk
obtains the character widths from the
.RI . tfm
file, which must exist in the standard search path.  It also must be
able to find a file
.B psfonts.map
(formatted as in
.BR dvips (1)),
listing the available fonts.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-q
Operate quietly;
.I i.e.,
without writing any messages to the standard output.
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.IP \fBTEXFONTS\fP \w'\fBDVIPSHEADERS\fP'u+2m
Colon-separated list of directories to search for the
.RI . tfm
file associated with the font.  An extra colon in the list will include the
system default path at that point.
.IP \fBDVIPSHEADERS\fP
Colon-separated list of directories to search for the ghostscript
driver file
.B render.ps
and for any PostScript font files
.RI (. pfa
or
.RI . pfb
files).  An extra colon in the list behaves as with
.SB TEXFONTS.
.IP \fBTEXCONFIG\fP
Path to search for the file
.BR psfonts.map .
Only the first such file will be used.
.SH BUGS
.B gsftopk
sometimes has trouble with fonts with very complicated characters
(such as the Seal of the University of California).  This is because
.B gsftopk
uses the
.B charpath
operator to determine the bounding box of each character.  If the character
is too complicated, then it will exceed the allowable length of a path;
this causes
.B gsftopk
to terminate with an error message
.IP
.B "Call to gs stopped by signal 10"
.LP
(The number may vary from system to system; it corresponds to a bus error
or a segmentation fault.)  This is actually a design limitation in PostScript,
exacerbated by a bug in
.BR ghostscript ,
rather than a bug in
.B gsftopk
itself.  To work around this bug,
.B gsftopk
can be instructed to use the bounding box provided with the font (if one
exists) instead of finding a bounding box for each character.  To do this,
include the string
.IP
.B /usefontbbox true def
.LP
in the
.B psfonts.map
file;
.IR e.g. ,
.IP
.B ucseal """/usefontbbox true def"""
.LP
This will not affect use of the font by
.BR dvips .
