The examples in this distribution have been minimally ported to R6.
That means they compile and run, but they have not been converted to
use new R6 interfaces, and no R6-specific examples have yet been added.

The examples have only been compiled and tested for R6 on SunOS 4.1.3.

Bug reports should be sent to adrian@ora.com.
Later versions of these examples will appear on ftp.uu.net
in /published/oreilly/xbook/
