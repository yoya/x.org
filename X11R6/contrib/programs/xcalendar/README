HISTORY:
       The original xcalendar (written by Roman J. Budzianowski) could only
       display one month at a time and allowed for no scrolling between months
       or days.  Enhancements were made by myself and Beth Chaney to allow 
       for scrolling.  A few bugs were also fixed.  These enhancements
       (and some layout changes) were placed on export.lcs.mit.edu in September
       of 1990 by Roman.  In the summer of 1991, Roman turned over support
       and further development to me.  

       Version 3.0 was part of the X11R5 contrib distribution.  

       Version 3.1 included some internationalization attempts
       and a few other enhancements.

       Version 4.0 adds Motif as a compile time option and a
       holiday file.  Released as part of the X11R6 contrib.
