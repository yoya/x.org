This distribution contains two programs, xrsh and xrlogin. 

Both are shell scripts.

Xrsh is designed to allow you to start an X client on a remote machine
with the window displayed on the current server's $DISPLAY.  It has
many options that give you the ability to propagate environment
variables (including DISPLAY) to the remote system and works with
various types of X server access control including xauth and xhost.

In X11R4 and previous, xrsh was called "xon".  There was a script in
X11R5 by Keith Packard by that name which has no relation to the
originally distributed xon script.

Xrlogin opens a local xterm window and runs rlogin or telnet to
connect to a remote machine.

Starting with the X11R5 version, xrsh has many new features
including a multitude of X access control methods, the ability to pass
arbitrary environment variables to the remote host and the ability to
start a client on a different screen than the current one.

To install on your system, the usual thing is to do an "xmkmf"
followed by a "make install".

IMPORTANT:

If you are running a System V variant, you may need to change the
first line of both scripts from "#!/bin/sh" to ": ".
