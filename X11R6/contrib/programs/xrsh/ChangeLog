	* Fixed bug introduced in 5.7 where -auth xauth would not take
	input from pipe, but from /dev/null instead.  Fixed bug and upped
	version to 5.8.  Thanks to Charles Karney <Karney@Princeton.EDU>
	for finding and reporting the bug.

	* Added some /dev/null redirections to rsh commands to fix hanging
	problem when using csh as login shell and xrsh'ing to some remote
	OSes like HP-UX.  Upped version to 5.7.

	* Changed Imakefile comments from # to XCOMM as per gildea@x.org. 
	* Added double quotes around assignment of xcmdargs at gildea's
	suggestion.

	* Released version 5.6 to X Consortium for X11R6 contrib after
	making only minor cosmetic changes from the version called 5.6
	below.  Most (all?) of the changes were in the supporting README
	type files and man pages.

	* Added -version feature at the request of rws@x.org
	Now at version 5.6.

Mon Sep 14 09:57:27 1992  James J Dempsey  (jjd at spchp17)

	* Fixed a bug in xrlogin reported by dave@csis.dit.csiro.au.
	The problem was that if xterm options were sent in on the xrlogin
	cmd line, $item wasn't set and generates a "test: arg expected"
	error.  Replaced with [ ! -z ""].  Updated version to 5.3.

Fri Jun  5 10:06:39 1992  James J Dempsey  (jjd@spchp17)

	* Fixed line in xrsh.man which caused groff to barf due to 
	quoting.  Reported by Paul Eggert <eggert@twinsun.com>	 

Thu Apr 16 15:32:39 1992  James J Dempsey  (jjd@spchp17)

	* Changed the xrsh man page to remove the restriction that ultrix
	should run with /bin/sh5.  Now that I use "set -" instead of "set
	--" it works with the old Ultrix /bin/sh again.

Mon Mar  9 15:28:09 1992  James J Dempsey  (jjd@spchp17)

	* made some changes to xrsh and xrlogin due to suggestions
	by Charles Karney <karney@theory.pppl.gov>. 

	Changed xrlogin to take arbitrary xterm options.  Made those
	options be after "-name -title" so users can override.

	Fixed a bug where client host was checking to see if it was the
	same as localhost in order to set display to :0, when it should
	have been checking to see if it was the same as displayhost.

	Added default_auth_type so sites can customize the default
	authorization to be something other than xhost.

	New xrsh version 5.3.
	New xrlogin version 5.2.
