.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Xearth
sets the X root window to an image of the Earth, as seen from your
favorite vantage point in space, correctly shaded for the current
position of the Sun. By default,
.I xearth
updates the displayed image every five minutes. The time between
updates can be changed with the \fB\-wait\fP option (see below).
.I Xearth
can also render directly into PPM and GIF files instead of drawing in
the root window; see the \fB\-ppm\fP and \fB\-gif\fP options (below).

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
\fIXearth\fP understands the following command line options and X
resources:

.TP
.B \-pos \fIpos_spec\fP
Specify the position from which the Earth should be viewed. The
\fIpos_spec\fP (position specifier) consists of three components: a
keyword (one of \fIfixed\fP, \fIsunrel\fP, or \fIorbit\fP) and two
numerical values. (If you're having problems getting xearth to accept
a position specifier as a command line argument, make sure and read
the comments about position specifier delimiters and using explicit
quoting in the fourth paragraph following this one.)

If the position specifier keyword is \fIfixed\fP, the numerical values
indicate the latitude and longitude, expressed in decimal degrees, of
a viewing position that is fixed with respect to the Earth's
surface. Positive and negative values of latitude correspond to
positions north and south of the equator, respectively. Positive and
negative values of longitude correspond to positions east and west of
Greenwich, respectively.

If the position specifier keyword is \fIsunrel\fP, the numerical
values indicate the offsets in latitude and longitude, expressed in
decimal degrees, of a viewing position that is fixed with respect to
the position of the Sun. Positive and negative values of latitude and
longitude are interpreted as for the \fIfixed\fP keyword.

If the position specifier keyword is \fIorbit\fP, the numerical values
indicate the period (in hours) and orbital inclination (in decimal
degrees) of a simple circular orbit; the viewing position follows this
orbit. Astute readers will surely note that these parameters are not
sufficient to uniquely specify a single circular orbit. This problem
is solved by limiting the space of possible orbits to those positioned
over 0 degrees latitude, 0 degrees longitude at time zero (the Un*x
epoch, see \fBtime(3)\fP).

Components of a position specifier are delimited by either whitespace,
forward slashes (/), or commas. Note that using whitespace to separate
position specifier components when invoking \fIxearth\fP from a shell
may require explicit quoting to ensure the entire position specifier
is passed as a single argument. For example, if you want to use spaces
to delimit components and are using a "typical" shell, you'd need to
use something like:

.nf
    -pos "fixed 42.4 -71.1"
.fi

or

.nf
    -pos 'fixed 42.4 -71.1'
.fi

to make things work. If you'd rather not have to explicitly quote
things, you can use forward slashes or commas instead of spaces to
separate components, as shown below.

.nf
    -pos fixed,42.4,-71.1
    -pos fixed/42.4/-71.1
.fi

If a position specifier is not provided, \fIxearth\fP uses a default
position specifier of "sunrel 0 0" (such that the entire day side of
the Earth is always visible).

.TP
.B \-sunpos \fIsun_pos_spec\fP
Specify a fixed point on the Earth's surface where the Sun is always
directly overhead. The \fIsun_pos_spec\fP (Sun position specifier)
consists of two components, both numerical values; these components
are interpreted as the latitude and longitude (in decimal degrees) of
the point where the Sun is directly overhead.

The details provided for position specifiers (see above) about the
interpretation of positive and negative latitude and longitude values
and the characters used to delimit specifier components apply to Sun
position specifiers as well.

By default,
.I xearth
calculates the actual position of the Sun and updates this position
with the progression of time.

.TP
.B \-mag \fIfactor\fP
Specify the magnification of the displayed image. The diameter of the
rendered Earth image is \fIfactor\fP times the shorter of the width
and height of the image (see the \fB\-size\fP option, below).

.TP
.B \-size \fIsize_spec\fP
Specify the size of the image to be rendered. The \fIsize_spec\fP
(size specifier) consists of two components, both positive integers;
these components are interpreted as the width and height (in pixels)
of the image.

The details provided for position specifiers (see above) about the
characters used to delimit specifier components apply to size
specifiers as well.

When rendering into the X root window, these values default to the
dimensions of the root window. When producing a PPM or GIF file
instead of drawing in the X root window (see the \fB\-ppm\fP and
\fB\-gif\fP options, below), both values default to 512.

.TP
.B \-shift \fIshift_spec\fP
Specify that the center of the rendered Earth image should be shifted
by some amount from the center of the image. The \fIshift_spec\fP
(shift specifier) consists of two components, both integers; these
components are interpreted as the offsets (in pixels) in the X and Y
directions.

The details provided for position specifiers (see above) about the
characters used to delimit specifier components apply to shift
specifiers as well.

By default, the center of the rendered Earth image is aligned with the
center of the image.

.TP
.B \-shade \fP|\fB \-noshade
Enable/disable shading. When shading is enabled, the surface of the
Earth is shaded according to the current position of the Sun (and the
values provided for the \fB\-day\fP and \fB\-night\fP options, below).
When shading is disabled, use flat colors (green and blue) to render
land and water. Shading is enabled by default.

.TP
.B \-label \fP|\fB \-nolabel
Enable/disable labeling. If labeling is enabled and \fIxearth\fP is
rendering into the X root window, provide a label in the lower
right-hand corner that indicates the current date and time and current
viewing and sun positions. Labeling is disabled by default.

.TP
.B \-markers \fP|\fB \-nomarkers
Enable/disable markers. If markers are enabled and \fIxearth\fP is
rendering into the X root window, display small red circles and text
labels indicating the location of interesting places on the Earth's
surface. Markers are enabled by default.

At present, the list of locations for which markers are placed
consists of some three dozen major cities; no hooks (beyond editing
the source code and recompiling!) are provided for adding to or
changing this list. This limitation will likely be addressed in a
future version of \fIxearth\fP.

.TP
.B \-stars \fP|\fB \-nostars
Enable/disable stars. If stars are enabled, the black background of
"space" is filled with a random pattern of "stars" (individual white
pixels). The fraction of background pixels that are turned into stars
can be controlled with the \fB\-starfreq\fP option (see below). Stars
are enabled by default.

.TP
.B \-starfreq \fIfrequency\fP
Set the density of the random star pattern (see \fB\-stars\fP, above);
\fIfrequency\fP indicates the fraction of background pixels that
should be turned into "stars". The default value of \fIfrequency\fP is
0.002.

.TP
.B \-grid \fP|\fB \-nogrid
Enable/disable the display of a longitude/latitude grid on the Earth's
surface. The spacing of major grid lines and dots between major grid
lines can be controlled with the \fB\-grid1\fP and \fB\-grid2\fP
options (see below). Grid display is disabled by default.

.TP
.B \-grid1 \fIgrid1\fP
Specify the spacing of major grid lines if grid display (see
\fB\-grid\fP, above) is enabled; major grid lines are drawn with a
90/\fIgrid1\fP degree spacing. The default value for \fIgrid1\fP is 6,
corresponding to 15 degrees between major grid lines.

.TP
.B \-grid2 \fIgrid2\fP
Specify the spacing of dots along major grid lines if grid display
(see \fB\-grid\fP, above) is enabled. Along the equator and lines of
longitude, grid dots are drawn with a 90/(\fIgrid1\fP x \fIgrid2\fP)
degree spacing. The spacing of grid dots along parallels (lines of
latitude) other than the equator is adjusted to keep the surface
distance between grid dots approximately constant. The default value
for \fIgrid2\fP is 15; combined with the default \fIgrid1\fP value of
6, this corresponds to placing grid dots on a one degree spacing.

.TP
.B \-day \fIpct\fP
Specify the brightness that should be used to shade the day side of
the Earth when shading is enabled. \fIPct\fP should be an integer
between 0 and 100, inclusive, where 0 indicates total darkness and 100
indicates total illumination. This value defaults to 100.

.TP
.B \-night \fIpct\fP
Specify the brightness that should be used to shade the night side of
the Earth when shading is enabled. \fIPct\fP should be an integer
between 0 and 100, inclusive, where 0 indicates total darkness and 100
indicates total illumination. This value defaults to 10.

.TP
.B \-gamma \fIgamma_value\fP
When \fIxearth\fP is rendering into the X root window, adjust the
colors \fIxearth\fP uses by a gamma value. Values less than 1.0 yield
darker colors; values greater than 1.0 yield brighter colors. The
default \fIgamma_value\fP is 1.0.

.TP
.B \-wait \fIsecs\fP
When rendering into the X root window, wait \fIsecs\fP seconds between
updates. This value defaults to 300 seconds (five minutes).

.TP
.B \-timewarp \fItimewarp_factor\fP
Scale the apparent rate at which time progresses by
\fItimewarp_factor\fP. The default value of \fItimewarp_factor\fP is
1.0.

.TP
.B \-time \fIfixed_time\fP
Instead of using the current time to determine the "value" of
time-dependent positions (e.g., the position the sun), use a
particular \fIfixed_time\fP (expressed in seconds since the Un*x epoch
(see \fBtime(3)\fP).

.TP
.B \-onepix \fP|\fB \-twopix
Specify whether \fIxearth\fP should use one or two pixmaps when
rendering into the X root window. If only one pixmap is used, partial
redraws may be visible at times in the root window (when areas of the
root window are exposed and redrawn during the time \fIxearth\fP is
rendering the next image). If two pixmaps are used, \fIxearth\fP uses
them to double-buffer changes such that partial redraws are (almost?)
never seen. Using only one pixmap has the advantage of using quite a
bit less memory in the X server; this can be important in environments
where server-side memory is a fairly limited resource.

.TP
.B \-mono \fP|\fB \-nomono
If rendering into the X root window, enable/disable monocrhome mode.
Monochrome mode is enabled by default on systems with one-bit
framebuffers (see the "depth of root window" information provided by
\fBxdpyinfo(1)\fP) and disabled by default otherwise.

.TP
.B \-ncolors \fInum_colors\fP
If rendering into the X root window or a GIF output file, specify the
number of colors that should be used. (If markers are enabled (see
\fB\-markers\fP, above), the actual number of colors used may be one
larger than \fInum_colors\fP.) The default value of \fInum_colors\fP
is 64.

.TP
.B \-font \fIfont_name\fP
If rendering into the X root window, use \fIfont_name\fP for drawing
text labels (see \fB\-label\fP and \fB\-markers\fP, above). By
default, \fIxearth\fP uses the "variable" font.

.TP
.B \-fork \fP|\fB \-nofork
When rendering into the X root window, enable/disable forking. If
forking is enabled, \fIxearth\fP forks a child process to handle all
rendering calculations and screen updates (in essense, automatically
putting itself in the background). Forking is disabled by default.

.TP
.B \-nice \fIpriority\fP
Run the \fIxearth\fP process with priority \fIpriority\fP (see
\fBnice(1)\fP and \fBsetpriority(2)\fP). By default, \fIxearth\fP runs
at priority 0.

.TP
.B \-gif
Instead of drawing in the X root window, write a GIF file (eight-bit
color) to standard out.

.TP
.B \-ppm
Instead of drawing in the X root window, write a PPM file (24-bit
color) to standard out.

.TP
.B \-display \fIdpyname\fP
Attempt to connect to the X display named \fIdpyname\fP.

.TP
.B \-version
Print what version of
.I xearth
this is.

.SH MAJOR CAVEAT
This version of \fIxearth\fP (version 0.92) supports both one- and
eight-bit framebuffers. Systems with other than one- and eight-bit
framebuffers are only "supported" (indirectly) to the extent that
\fIxearth\fP can generate PPM and GIF files that can be fed directly
into your favorite image viewer (e.g., xv, xloadimage).

.SH NOTES
This man page documents 
.I xearth
version 0.92. There are a number of improvements that I'd \fIlove\fP
to make, but I really should be working on my thesis instead of
hacking on this.

The map information used in
.I xearth
was derived from the "CIA World Data Bank II map database," as taken
from some "cbd" files that were apparently originally generated by
Brian Reid at DECWRL.

Thanks to Jamie Zawinski for suggesting that I look at his
xscreensaver package for a good example of how to use the resource and
command line option parts of Xt; his code saved me piles of lossage.

Kudos to Jef Poskanzer for his excellent PBMPLUS toolkit.
