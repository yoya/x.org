README file for xearth, version 0.92

WHAT IS IT?

    Xearth sets the X root window to an image of the Earth, as seen
    from your favorite vantage point in space, correctly shaded for
    the current position of the Sun. By default, xearth updates the
    displayed image every five minutes; the time between updates can
    be changed using either X resources or a command line
    option. Xearth can also render directly into PPM and GIF files
    instead of drawing in the root window; see the man page for
    details.

    See the HISTORY file for a list of changes since versions 0.5 and
    0.92.


IMPORTANT!

    This version of xearth (version 0.92) is an evolution of the only
    version(s) of xearth that I ever released (versions 0.5, 0.9, and
    0.91). Unfortunately, some net.weenies chose to make some minor
    mods (and introduce bugs!) and "release" a bogus version 0.6
    without even notifying or consulting with me; this may be the
    version of xearth that you are currently using.

    Some of the command line options supported in the bogus version
    0.6 (e.g, those having to do with "geostatic") don't exist in this
    version -- their functionality (and more!) is available through
    other means. In addition, the meaning and syntax of some of the
    xearth command line options have changed, so you should probably
    give the new man page a good reading if things don't seem to be
    working as you expect.


MAJOR CAVEAT

    This version of xearth (version 0.92) supports both one- and
    eight-bit framebuffers. Systems with other than one- and eight-bit
    framebuffers are only "supported" (indirectly) to the extent that
    xearth can generate PPM and GIF files that can be fed directly
    into your favorite image viewer (e.g., xv, xloadimage).


WHERE TO GET IT?

    The latest-and-greatest version of xearth should be available via
    anonymous ftp from cag.lcs.mit.edu:/pub/tuna (or, for those web
    surfers out there, via a link from the xearth WWW home page
    http://cag-www.lcs.mit.edu/~tuna/xearth/index.html).


NOTES

    If you are trying to build xearth under SunOS 4.x using /bin/cc,
    make sure to read the section of the INSTALL file entitled
    "BUILDING UNDER SUNOS 4.x" regarding a compiler bug.

    There are a number of improvements that I'd love to make, but I
    really should be working on my thesis instead of hacking on this.

    The map information used in xearth was derived from the "CIA World
    Data Bank II map database," as taken from some "cbd" files that
    were apparently originally generated by Brian Reid at DECWRL.

    Running in the background on a Sun 4/110, xearth requires around
    30 CPU seconds each time it redraws an image in the root window.
    With the default time-between-redraws of 300 seconds, I hardly
    even notice the extra CPU load. Your mileage may vary, of course,
    especially on slower machines.

    CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of

    Thanks to Jamie Zawinski for suggesting that I look at his
    xscreensaver package for a good example of how to use the resource
    and command line option parts of Xt; his code saved me piles of
    lossage.

    Kudos to Jef Poskanzer for his excellent PBMPLUS toolkit.


IDEAS FOR FUTURE WORK

    Support for other visual classes and depths.

    Better error recovery (better than "assert()", anyway).

    Add options/resources that specify colors other than the default
    green, blue, red, white, and black.

    Add hooks for user-specified marker locations.

    Code for tracking real-life orbits ("-pos hubble").

    Support for supersampling/antialiasing.

    can't guarantee that I'll get around to doing anything about them
    in a timely fashion.
