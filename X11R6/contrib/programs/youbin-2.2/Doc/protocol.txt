	youbin protocol specification (Protocol Ver. 2)

						By K.Agusa and S.Yamamoto
						1993/09/02

1 Introduction

youbin protocol consists of the following seven kinds of packets which
are identified by the first character.

a) Wake up packet (from client to server)
Client requests the registration of his name and start of youbin service.

b) Registered packet (from server to client)
Acknowledgement of Wake up packet.

c) NAK packet (from server to client)
NAK to Wake up packet. Wake up packet is rejected for some reason.

d) Status report packet (from server to!client)
Current state of mail spool (size and last modify time).

e) Thanks packet (from client to server)
Responce to Status report packet. This packet is a kind of "keep alive"
packet.

f) Update request packet (from client to server)
Demand of the report of the current state of his mail spool.  When the
server receives this packet, it check the spool and transmit Status
report packet.

g) Biff packet (from /bin/mail to server)
Notification of mail arrival by the local mail delivery program.

h) Quit packet (bi-direction between server and client)
End of service.

The use of youbin is categorized with the following 3 phases.

	Registration phase
	ST (Status-Thanks) phase
	Termination phase


2 Registration phase

A user who wants the notification of his mail arrival send a Wake up
packet to register his name at the youbin server.  The form of Wake up
packet is

	W <userName> <protocolVersion> [<options>]

[] shows optional parameters. That is <options> can be omitted.

The userName is login name at the server. The protocolVersion make it
possible to avoid queer chatter between server and client with version
mismatch. The options field can hold only "B" at this time. This "B"
option request the server to send not only the mail arrival
notification but also the header and first part of new arriving mail.

	W <userName> <protocolVersion> B

When server receives Wake up packet, it checks the version and
authorization of userName. If there is no problem about the version
and authorization, it replys with Registered packet whose first
argument is client ID. The second argument of Registered packet is a
timer value. If client has no packet from server for longer than this
period, it should try to reconnect. If server rejects Wake up packet,
it reply with NAK packet whose argument is the reject reason.

That is client will receive one of following reply to Wake up packet.

	R <userId> <interval>
	NAK <reason>

If client doed not receive any reply within 1 unit time (usually 3
minutes, site depend), client should send Wake up packet again. Server
avoid the duplicated registration of a certain user. However it is
recommended not to send repeated Wake up packet with in 1 unit time.


3 ST (Status-Thanks) phase

Server send Status report packet in the period between 1 to 2 unit
time since it receives the Thanks packet from client. This is a kind
of " keep alive " packet and required because of no guarantee of
packet transfer in the case UDP.

Server sends Status report packet asynchronously when it receives Biff
packet or Update request packet. The form of Status report packet is
one of the followings.

	S <size> <date>
	S <size> <date> <mailHeader>

After client receives Status report packet, it reply with T hanks
packet with in 2/3 unit time. Since server sends Status report packet
to all client at one time, there can be a congestion of Thanks
packets.  To avoid this congestion, it is recommended for client to
reply with random delay with in 2/3 unit time. The form of T packet is
shown in the following.

	T <clientID>

If client receives Status report packet during this waiting period, it
should reply with Thanks packet right away since the Status report
packet is asynchronous packet.

Server resends Status report packet to the client which does not reply
within 2 unit times. After that, server resends 2 times at ever Unit
Time tick to get the connection with teh client. If there is still no
response from the client to this invitation, server removes his name
from the registration table and terminate youbin service to the
client.

If client has no Status report packet from server within 6 unit time,
the connection is destroyed with some reason. So client exits the
current ST phase and goes to Registration phase if required. 6 Unit
Time is a sum of the normal ST phase waiting time 2 + servers
struggling time of reconnection 3 + some margin 1.

Asynchronously server sends Status report packet to client when the
change of mail spool state by mail arrival and reading. When mail
arrives, the mail header is sent if client requests. Reading mail is
detected with Update request packet. There are several way to send
Update request packet. Some may use POP with youbin extension (patch
is available) or send Update request packet manually. Since clientID
is a kind of magic number, a user who sends Update request packet
manually may want Update request packet with not number but name. So
there are two types of Update request packet.

	U /<clientID>
	U <userName>

There is a mechanism to notify mail arrivals, named "biff". youbin
server is designed to work with this mechanism. The following packet
is a special Update request packet for compatibility.

	<userName>@<offset>


4 Termination phase

Server can detect the termination of client service by Thanks packet's
not arriving. However, client is recommended to notify its termination
to server explicitly.  For this, Quit packet is prepared.  The form of
Quit packet is

	Q <clientID>

When server receives this packet, client is removed from the
registration table.

The termination of server's service notified of clients by Quit packet
also. The argument of Quit packet from server is "hup" (Hang UP) if
server is reinitialized, and "quit" if server actually quits. When
client receives Quit packet with "hup", client may enter the
registration phase with appropriate delay.

	Q hup
	Q quit


5 State transition diagram

The youbin protocol is shown in the state transition diagram of server
and client. Here, TO means an event of timer for unit time, and TO'
for 6 Unit TImes. TO' is the second argument <interval> of Registerd
packet from server.

The file "state.eps" includes the transition diagram in EPS format.
