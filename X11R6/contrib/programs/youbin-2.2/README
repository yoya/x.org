1 Introduction

The conventional mail arrival notification service (biff) which
assumes that the user is logging in at mail server becomes late in the
age as the network technology has advanced. The number of users for
such service is decreasing. Xbiff is widely used in X Window System
environment. However, it has the following problems. (1) NFS mount or
msgchk of POP alternatively, (2) checking mail with polling instead
event driven, (3) fully dependency on X Window System. Moreover, many
users who operate with a character based terminal do not use "biff"
because it may disturb the screen when mail arrives. Instead, they
prefer the shell service of "You have new mail.". This service is not
available when we use the network based mail delivery protocol such
that POP, since shell can not access mail spool directly.

youbin (it means mail in Japanese) protocol to make the biff protocol
correspond to the network environment as a protocol to notify of the
arrival of mail. youbin includes all the function of conventional biff
and xbiff.


2 Outline of youbin service

youbin is a kind of biff in the network age. When youbin is used, the
mail spool of a certain, specific machine (mail server) is observed to
inform the arrival of mail to a user at an arbitrary machine through
the network.  On the other hands, the conventional "biff" informs only
the user who logs in at the machine with the mail spool. Combining
with POP, youbin eliminate a lot of NFS mount of mail spool for mail
arrival checking.

Since youbin is designed with event driven, the user is promptly
informed of status change of mail spool caused by mail arriving and
reading.


3 Fruits

(1) The "biff" service can be available in network environments.

(2) Useless polling is cleared away. Instead, the status change is
detected with an event from mail delivery program (/bin/mail) and mail
reading program (e.g. POP). As a result, troublesome file export of
mail server can be omitted. This contributes the security also.

(3) Because the protocol is light compared with xbiff, the load of the
mail server can be decreased.


4 Outline of protocol

In the following, the server of youbin is called youbind.

(1) Arrival of mail

/bin/mail puts out the packet to the biff port (512/udp) to inform the
mail arrival when newly arrived mail is written in the spool of mail
server.  Comsat daemon running on mail server usually receives this
packet and displays the message of the mail arrival on the terminal of
the user who ordered "biff y". Or, the dummy file is updated so that
the shell may know the arrival of mail.

The arrival of mail is notified of youbin client on an arbitrary
machine everywhen youbind receives the notification from /bin/mail in
the youbin service. The following client programs are available.

	xyoubin		client like xbiff
	YouBin.app 	client like xbiff for NeXT
	youbin		client for character base user

(2) Detection of reading mail

The biff service notifies only of the arrival of mail. On the other
hand, xbiff requires the event of the mail reading to display the mail
spool status (whether mail is in spool or not). To detect mail read
with some command such as "inc" of POP, the youbin package includes
two programs. They exclude polling and gives quick notification of the
mail spool status change.

However, because the less reliable but light communication based on
UDP is adopted, the change of the spool is actually examined once at a
specified seconds (usually 180 seconds) to deal with the case of
transmission loss. The polling interval of xbiff is 30 seconds
typically.

(1) A patch is applied to popd to add the function to notify youbind
of the change of the spool (or possible change). youbind informs of
youbin client when finding the spool's actual change.

(2) The change of the spool is informed of youbind with the hook of
mh-e. 


5 Use of Server

(1) Starting service
youbin server is invoked as a daemon. Usually, youbind is started at
boot time. In some file of /etc/rc.*, please add below one line.

/etc/youbind &

(2) Options
    -d       Debug mode.
    -h       Help: print out the usage.
    -t       Trace: print out beginning and end of service.
    -A port  Auxiliary Service port name

If /bin/mail on your system informs of the arrival of mail via
different port, use -A option. For instance, MIPS requires the
following option. 


	/etc/youbind -A mbiff


6 Use of Client

6.1 xyoubin (client for X Window System)

xyoubin replaces with xbiff.

    -empty pixmap  Pixmap to be shown when no new mail is present.
    -flip/-nofilp  Specifies whether or not the image should be  
		   inverted.
    -full pixmap   Pixmap to be shown when new mail has arrived.
    -help    	   Help: print out the usage.
    -pipe    	   Executed by other program (don't exec child process).
    -server host   Server host name.
    -sound file    Sound file (SunOS only)
    -volume %      Specifies how loud the bell should be rung.

Almost all options are the same as xbiff.

(1) Mail server is specified by the server option. It is assumed  
that a local machine is the mail server if this option is not specified.

(2) With sound option, xyougin informs of the mail arrival by the
specified sound data via /dev/audio device of Sun.

(3) empty and full option specify the pixmap displyed when there is a
mail and no mail respectively.

(4) Flip controls reversing the bit map. By default, the display is
reversed when mail arriving.

These options can be specified as the following resources.

XYoubin*emptyPixmap:		<pixmap>
XYoubin*fullPixmap:		<pixmap>
XYoubin*flip:			<boolean>
XYoubin*server:			<string>
XYoubin*sound:			<string>
XYoubin*volume:			<int>

6.2 YouBin.app (client for NeXT)

YouBin.app is started by a double clicking its icon. Refer to
NeXTclient/Japanese.lproj/Help/TableOfContents.rtf for more
information.

6.3 youbin (client for of character base system)

(1) Run youbin as a background job.

% youbin -s <server name> &

Then, the message will be displayed when mail arrives, just as "biff"
program is used like

New mail for <user name>@<mail server> has arrived:

When -b option is applied, From header, Subject header will be
displayed accompanied with up to seven lines of mail content. 
Moreover, this program is used in xyoubin, YouBin.app and so on as a
child process.

(2) The screen is disturbed when mail arriving notification is sent
asynchronously. Therefore, a lot of users are using the check mail of
the shell function. This function can be made the best use of by using
youbin. The -m option specifies the file to which the message informed
of the mail arrival is written. youbin imitates the state of the
informed spool from the server with this file. The file size is
changed to 0 when there is no mail at mail server. The file size grows
when the mail is appended at mail server. If this file is specified as
a mail check file for the shell, the shell displays "You have new
mail." as for the arrival of mail when the shell prompts user commands.
In the case of csh, add below two lines to <HOME>/.cshrc.

youbin -m ~/.mail_check_file -s server_name &
set mail = ~/.mail_check_file

(3) Options for youbin

    -b	     Biff mode: send From, Subject and the first 7 lines.
    -d	     Debug mode.
    -h	     Help: print out the usage.
    -m path  Mail Check File.
    -p prog  Program to be executed and connected via pipe.
    -s host  Host name of mail server.


7 Other programs

Reading mail can be instantaneously notified of youbind by using one
of following patches.

7.1 Patch for popd

Mh-6.8-youbin.patch is prepared as a patch for popd attached to MH6.8.
This patch enables to notify youbind of the change of the size of the
spool by inc etc. 


How to patch is in the following. <MHTOP> shows a top directory of the
source tree of MH6.8.

(1) Patch to
    <MHTOP>/conf/mhconfig.c
    <MHTOP>/conf/makefiles/support/pop
    <MHTOP>/conf/support/pop/popser.c

	% cd <MHTOP>
	% patch -p1 < mh-6.8-youbin.patch

(2) Copy Sendto.c of the youbin package to <MHTOP>/support/pop.

(3) To <MHTOP>/conf/MH, add 

	options YOUBIN

(If this option is omitted, the original popd is obtained.)

(4) Change directory to <MHTOP>/conf. And modify mhconfig and Makefile.

	% cd <MHTOP>/conf
	% make
	% mhconfig MH

The following operation is the same as usual MH installation.

7.2 Patch for popper

The following files are prepared as patchs to popper.

popper-1.831beta-youbin.patch:  	patch to popper-1.831beta.
popper-1.831b-rpop-youbin.patch:	patch to popper-1.831beta
					patched with RPOP

How to patch is shown in the following.
<TOP> is a top directory of the source tree of popper.

(1) Patch to 
    <TOP>/Makefile
    <TOP>/pop_updt.c
    <TOP>/version.c.

	% cd <TOP>
	% patch -p1 < popper-1.831beta-youbin.patch

(2) Copy sendto.c of the youbin package to <TOP>.

(3) Confirm -DYOUBIN in the line of "CFLAGS=..." of <TOP>/Makefile.
If not, it generates original popper.

(4) The following operation is the same as usual popper installation.

Note: Use popper-1.831b-rpop.youbin.patch as a patch file if the patch
for RPOP is applied.

7.3 Hook of mh-e

The change of the mail spool status can be informed of youbind
explicitly and immediately when mh-e "inc"s by adding the following  
codes to <HOME>/.emacs.

(setq mh-inc-folder-hook 
      '((lambda ()
	   (let ((program	"<BINDIR>/sendto")
		 (server	"<mail server>")
		 (service	"biff")
		 (user		(user-login-name)))
	      (start-process "" nil
			     program server service (concat "U " user))))))

Set <BINDIR> and <mail server> appropriately. These are site
dependent. Especially, <BINDIR> should be the same as $(BINDIR) of
Imakefile.

7.4 Patch for xpbiff

xpbiff-1.26-youbin.patch is prepared as a patch to xpbiff of youbin
protocol. xpbiff with this patch responds quickly to changes of the
mail spool because of event driven operation. The difference of the
original xpbiff is that patched xpbiff displays only newly arrived
mail headers. That means this does not disply the mail headers which
had arrived before xpbiff is activated.

How to patch and compile is shown in the following. <XPBIFF> is the
directory holding the source of xpbiff.

(1) Patch xpbiff-1.26-youbin.patch to xpbiff.c, Imakefile, and  
xpbiff.man.

	% cd <XPBIFF>
	% patch -p1 < xpbiff-1.26-youbin.patch

(2) Change Imakefile if necessary. Following definitions are added in
Imakefile with the patch.

	BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
	DEFINES = -DYOUBIN -DBINDIR=\"$(BINDIR)\"

BINDIR specifies the directory in which youbin is installed. Add
-DX11R3, -DSYSV, and -DSLOW_MACHINE to DEFINES according to the
environment. -DNO_CUSERID, -DMHSCAN are not needed.

(3) Making Makefile and compilation

	% xmkmf
	% make

(4) Installation

	% make install

The options added for youbin are the following.

	-pipe	     Executed by other program (don't exec child process).
	-server host Server host name.
	-nopreserve  Not preserve headers

-pipe and - server are the same as xyoubin. -nopreserve displays only
the headers of the newly arrived mail. It does not display the
headers stored in the mail spool. These options can be specified with
the resources.

XPbiff*pipe:		<boolean>
XPbiff*server:		<string>
XPbiff*preserve		<boolean>

Because polling is no more used with youbin protocol, the options

	-polling_time  time (msec)

is invalid.

Other options and the resources are the same as xpbiff. Refer to the
manual of xpbiff for details.

8.4 Configuration

Set the variables of Imakefile appropriately.

	BINDIR = /usr/local/bin
	SERVER_BINDIR = /etc

BINDIR is a directory in which xyoubin, youbin, and sendto are
installed. SERVER_BINDIR is a directory for youbind.

When Pixmap is used for display, the beginning # of the following lines
should be removed.

	# Uncomment following lines, if you want to use pixmap.
	# XPM_DEFS = -DUSE_XPM
	# XPM_LIBS = str_to_pixmap.o locate_pixmap.o
	# XPM_FLAGS = -lXpm -lXwchar

Because Xpm library (libXpm.a) is used, it is possible to compile only
when X11R5/contrib/lib/xpm has been installed.

8.5 Compilation
Execute the followings.

% xmkmf
% make

8.6 Test

It is necessary to stop comsat when comsat is in inetd.conf or having
already been running. Add '#' at the first column of the line 

	comsat dgram  udp  wait  root /usr/etc/in.comsat  in.comsat

in the file /etc/inetd.conf. Then send HUP signal to inetd to reread
/etc/inetd.conf.

% kill -HUP <process id of inetd>

(1) Start of server

Login as root. Execute 

% youbind -d

(2) Start of client

Execute youbin. Send mail to the user who execute youbin. If he gets a
message 

	New mail for <user name>@<mail server> has arrived:

then youbin and youbind operate well. When you want to test client
from a different machine than mail server, please specify the host
name of mail server with -s option.

	youbin -s <mail server>

8.7 Installation and operation

The command 

% make install

will install all related files.
Add following lines to /etc/rc.local in the case of BSD, and to
/etc/rc.* in the case of SYSV. They start youbin services.

if [ -f <SERVER_BIN>/youbind ]; then
	<SERVER_BIN>/youbind;	(echo -n ' youbind')	>/dev/console
fi

Here, <SERVER_BINDIR> is a directory specified in Imakefile.

8.8 Compilation and installation of YouBin.app

(1) Change directory to NeXTclient with FileViewer. Double click the
icon of PB.project. Then Project Builder is activated. Push the button
"Builder". To field "Argument", type in

	install INSTALLDIR=/LocalApps

Then push the "BUILD" button.

If you have not installed Developer Package, you can install the
attached binary package.

% cd NeXTclient
% tar cf - ./YouBin.app | (cd /LocalApps; tar xf -)

(2) retrieve
Use Terminal.app and change directory to NeXTclient/retrieve.

% make

It makes "retrieve". Then

% su
Password: 

% cp retrieve /LocalApps/YouBin.app/retrieve
% chown root /LocalApps/YouBin.app/retrieve
% chmod 4755 /LocalApps/YouBin.app/retrieve

(3) youbin
Change directory to where (2) is done (if you did not execute (2), do
% make youbin first).

% cp youbin /LocalApps/YouBin.app/youbin
% chown root /LocalApps/YouBin.app/youbin
% chmod 4755 /LocalApps/YouBin.app/youbin


9 Problems and ToDo

9.1 Problem

Nothing.

9.2 ToDo

(10) Add options to xyoubin. -debug may be needed.  It should accept
all options which can be used for youbin.
(13) Client program for Macintosh and Windows.
(16) Default server name should be defined at compilation time, instead
hard coding as LOCAL_HOST.
(17) terminfo should be used in the case of SYSV since it has no
struct sgttyb
(19) No default resource file.


10 Changes

Ver. 0.9 -> 1.0 and/or protocol ver. 1 -> 2.

(1) -A option is added for youbind
It enables server on MIPS to accept client requests via biff port. The
message from /bin/mail is accepted via mbiff port specified with -A
option.

(2) Quit packet is added.

(3) Option field is added to Wake up packet.
It enable to receive the summary of an arrived mail from server.

(4) Add Security check.
Authentification mechanism is the same as RPOP.
