MAJOR CHANGES

  Changes from xsession-1.0 to xsession-1.1
  -----------------------------------------

  o Problems fixed:

      - On SUN systems, it was impossible to stop jobs (CTRL-Z) running in an
	xterm launched from xsession.

      - When an unknown child process died, xsession printed a termination
        message, instead of ignoring it.

      - When the internal process table was full, xsession crashed instead of
        warning the user.

      - The `lockCommand' X resource had been forgotten in the app-defaults
	file.

      - Numerous prototypes rewritten in order to have a more portable code.

  o New features:

      - Two new variables are available for preprocessing a window manager's
	configuration file:

          XSESSION_VERSION:  the version number of xsession;
          XSESSION_PID:      the process number of xsession.

      - XSession now terminates cleanly if a SIGHUP signal is received.  You
        can use this feature to terminate the session from the window manager's
        menus by using the new XSESSION_PID variable.  For example, a "quit
        session" menu entry in your window manager's configuration file may
        look like this: exec "kill -HUP XSESSION_PID".

      - You may now choose between cpp and m4 at run-time, instead of at
        compilation-time.  The X resources for the window managers have
        changed: the third field of these resources should now contain one
        occurence of "%s", which will be replaced by "m4" or "cpp" according
        to the preprocessor you are using.

      - The new -console option (or the equivalent Console X resource) enables
        the user to redirect the console messages into the window of xsession.
	On some systems, this feature only works if xsession has been "setuid"
	to root.  This feature should work on most systems (we hope!).

      - The new -split option (or the equivalent SplitWindow X resource), when
        the console redirection is active, enables the user to view the console
        messages in a separate window.

      - If these two options are active, xsession fully conforms to the
        XConsole protocol.  If only the -console option is active, xsession
        half conforms to the XConsole protocol: it cannot serve the current
        value of its window to a new xconsole, because it doesn't know which
        output messages come from an application or a window manager and which
        ones come from the console.

      - The new -quiet option may be used to prevent xsession from displaying
        the warning messages and notifying the user each time an application
        or window manager is started (or ended).

      - A new menu of micellaneous operation has been added.  Currently, it
        only contains two entries: Clear Session Log and Clear Console Log.
