	X-BASED RUBIK'S CUBE
	====================	Rubik's cube X widgets, V4.2


    Prior to R6, it was tested on the following platforms:

	HP 3xx & 700		HP-UX 9.0x	X11R5
	Sun4, SPARC		SunOS 4.1.3	X11R4
	PC, 486 (*)		Linux 1.0	X11R5

    *	Keypad 5 key may not work, in which case, try it with the
	Num-Lock on.

    The most updated source could be found on ftp.x.org under
    /contrib/games/puzzles.

HOW TO BUILD?

    It should be easy. Edit the Imakefile for appropriate settings of
    variables SCOREFILE, RANDOM, then do:
	xmkmf
	make
	xrubik

    You should have Rubik.ad (or Stupid.ad) copied to $(HOME)/Rubik or 
    /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Rubik to run, especially if the background
    is similar to one of the faces. Edit this file for your preferences.
    You might want to move xrubik into /usr/bin/X11 (or wherever your
    X binaries are).
    You might also want to move xrubik.man to /usr/man/man6/xrubik.6

ANYTHING SPECIAL IN USING?

    Click on the left mouse button to move CCW.
    Click on the middle mouse button toggle the practice mode. (This is
      good for learning moves).  Also 'P' or 'p' does the same thing.
      One must double click on the middle mouse button if the puzzle is
      being worked on.
    Click on the right mouse button if you want to randomize the cube.
      Also 'R' or 'r' does the same thing.  One must double click on
      the right mouse button if the puzzle is being worked on.
    'U', 'u', 'I', or 'i' to increase or move up the number of cubes.
    'D' or 'd' to decrease or move down the number of cubes.
    'O' or 'o' to toggle orient mode. (I prefer the orient mode since
      it is slightly more challenging).
    'Q', 'q', Control-C to kill program.

    Key pad is defined for 2d rubik as:
        8
        ^
    4 < 5 > 6
        v
        2

    The key pad along with the use of the mouse will allow you to move the
    cube more than just CCW ie.,
		KP_8=>TOP
    KP=>LEFT	KP_5=>CW	KP_6=>RIGHT
   		KP_2=>BOTTOM

    Key pad for 3d rubik, use your intuition (is this a cop out or what?).
    The key pad is defined differently depending on which side of the cube
    your mouse is pointing at. One thing that stays the same is KP_5=>CW.

    The new control feature allows you to move the whole cube at once
    without being entered as a move.  Hold down the control key while
    using the left mouse button or the keypad.
 
    One has to orient the faces in orient mode, besides getting all the
    faces to be the same color. To do this one has to get the lines to
    be oriented in the same direction, this only matters with center
    cubes (ie. those cubes not on a corner or edge). This does add
    complexity so there are 2 sets of records.

    Try resizing the cube. Notice the puzzle resizes to take advantage
    of the "room" available.

    The title is in the following format:
	xrubik{2|3}d: {1|2|3|4|5|6} @ (<Number of moves>/\
		{<Record number of moves>|NEVER|PRACTICE}) - <Comment>
    {2|3}: current dimensional view
    {1|2|3|4|5|6}: number of cubes per edge
    {<Record...}: puzzle is either in practice mode or record mode
       In record mode, if there is no record of the current puzzle, it
       displays "NEVER".

    If you were looking for a self-solver, sorry. One of the problems in
    self-solvers the generally don't work for different number of cuts.
    If you know of one let me know. There is a real neat 3x3x3 cube called
    "magiccube" with a better 3-D look, a self-solver, and Motif. Use
    "archie" to find "magiccube" at the site nearest you.

    Also a tesseract (4D cube) would be nice. (I heard a 3^N cube has been
    built in software and solved!)

    Personally, I have solved 1-3 using this program, 2-5 using the
    physical cubes, and 6 to my knowledge have never been done (be the
    first on your block). If you want you can play with MAXCUBES and
    set it for 7 but then the graphics start messing up. 7 is neat
    because if it was a physical cube corner pieces would fall off when
    a face is turned.

    Refer to the man page for detailed command line options.

    If you want further information on puzzles, I'll be glad :-) to send
    it to you.

FOUND A BUG?

    Send bugs reports and fixes to the author. For bugs, please include
    as much information as to their location as possible, since I may not
    have the resources to duplicate the them.
