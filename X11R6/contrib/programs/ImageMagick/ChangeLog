ImageMagick 2.3.6

  o `info' was not declared static in network.c (thanks to
    farnham@wales.stortek.com).

  o TIFF images with a .Z or .gz extension are now recognized.

  o SUN monochrome images are now written correctly (thanks to
    dang@cogit.ign.fr).

    lare@eos913c.gsfc.nasa.gov).

  o Fixed memory leak in ReadPNMImage (thanks to
    jp@pong.polytechnique.fr).

  o import(1) now descends the X tree structure by default (see
    -descend).  import(1) also *grabs* the server while obtaining an
    image (thanks to hyde@snmail.jsc.nasa.gov and hstroyan@fc.hp.com).

  o Quantize stopped dithering in 2.3.4, this has been fixed (thanks to
    pederl@hpubgon.norway.hp.com).

    and the library routines are in the *magick* directory (suggested
    by rjohnson@shell.com).


ImageMagick 2.3.5

  o Images with a huge number of unique colors sometimes did not
    quantize properly (thanks to rjohnson@shell.com).

  o -gravity Center no longer results in segmentation fault for
    montage(1) (thanks to rjohnson@shell.com).

  o Multi-part images (i.e. a multi-page Postscript document) are
    written with the filename followed by a period (\fB.\fP) and the
    scene number.  You can now change this behavior by embedding a
    printf format specification in the file name.

  o ASCII PBM file and multi-part ASCII PNM files are now read
    correctly.

  o Previously the icon window had the same visual, depth, and colormap
    of the image window.  It is now the same visual, depth, and
    colormap as the root window.

  o Improved color reduction algorithm-- average mean error per pixel
    has been reduced.  Reducing an image to monochome has been
    improved.

  o Removed '-scale' from ImageMagick programs.  Use '%' instead with
    -geometry (e.g. to double the image size, -geometry 200%).  Also
    the aspect ratio of the image is now repected unless '!' is
    appended to the geometry specification.

  o You can now animate a sequence of images as the background pixmap
    of another window (suggested by mitchell@linus.mitre.org).

  o ImageMagick can now read Group 3 images (suggested by
    garyc@hds.com).

  o Added a reader for Photo CD images (requires hpcdtoppm).

    rogerskm@eplrx7.es.dupont.com).

  o Added four widgets to display(1) and animate(1): 1) File Browser;
    2) Dialog;  3) Notice;  and 4) Menu.

  o The correct image scene number is now displayed correctly when
    using animate(1) (thanks to chucks@orl.mmc.com).

    around each image tile.

  o On HP-SUX 9.0 there is a compiler bug.  Try compiling image.c
    without optimization to prevent a bus error with montage(1).

  o A warning was not being properly generated on a write error
    (thanks to zins@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de).

  o New '-page' option to set the size and location for a Postscript
    page.

  o Use '-update' with display(1) to automatically updates the image
    being displayed when it is modified (thanks to lustig@dupont.com).

    continuously (suggested by muller@mafalda.inria.fr).

  o Image rotations of 270 degrees would sometimes produce a
    segmentation fault on HP's.

  o GIF files written with ImageMagick 2.3.1 were unreadable
    (thanks to mjensen@bbn.com).

  o GIF files with multiple images would sometimes cause program to
    core dump (thanks to mjensen@bbn.com).

  o Added -undercolor to mogrify(1) to control undercolor removal and
    black generation on CMYK images.

  o Converting to the XWD format would sometimes dump core (thanks to
    kairys@bastar.enet.dec.com).

  o X resources now work correctly when clients are invoked with full
    pathname, i.e. /usr/local/bin/display (thanks to respl@mi.uib.no).

  o The delay in animate(1) now defaults to 8 milliseconds (thanks to
    respl@mi.uib.no).

  o ImageMagick did not read MIFF images with large image directories
    correctly.

  o Increased the default panning window size from 64x64 to 96x96.

  o Color reduction to monochrome with dithering is improved (thanks
    to mutz@kodak.com).

  o Added EPS as a file type for Encapsulated Postscript.

  o Minor improvements to Postscript output.

  o Removed program XtoPS(1).  There is an equivalent functionality
    with import(1):

      import image.ps import images.eps

  o The 'Info' command in animate(1) did not always reflect the proper
    image scene.

  o animate(1) sometimes displayed images with the wrong colormap on
    TrueColor or DirectColor visuals.

  o Popup windows were enlarged to make them easier to see.

  o Added a menu command to display(1) to load an image interactively
    (suggested by fouts@dallas.sgi.com).

  o montage was not allocating enough memory for it's directory (thanks
    to fouts@dallas.sgi.com).


ImageMagick 2.3

  o Added -descend option to import(1).  Obtain image by descending
    window hierarchy reading each subwindow and its colormap.  The
    final image is guarenteed to have the correct colors.

  o If pen color matched background color any annotations would not
    appear (thanks to dws@ssec.wisc.edu).

  o Thanks to jacobsd@solar.cor2.epa.gov:

      . mogrify now recognizes '-' as stdin and stdout.
      . PPM, PGM, and PBM image types are now recognized.
      . PPM, PGM, and PBM images were not always scaled correctly.

    windows whose depth is 12 or less.

  o On occasion images were incorrectly identified as XWD.

  o On occasion images with alpha data were being incorrectly
    runlength-encoded.

  o Sometimes icon's had a private colormap.  Icon's now use a shared
    colormap.

  o Keyboard accelerators did not work with -backdrop option.

  o Add new utility: combine-- combine images to create new images
    using digital compositing operators.

  o xtp failed under Solaris 2.1.

  o I486 compiler complained about includes within a function body of
    xtp/network.c (thanks to glenn@physics.su.OZ.AU).

  o I486 compiler complained about XWDfile.h being included twice
    (ReadXWD & WriteXWD) (thanks to glenn@physics.su.OZ.AU)

ImageMagick 2.2.4

  o time between images did not always match the value specified on
    -delay.

  o Sped up and reduced memory requirement of dithering.

  o GIF images were corrupted on SVR4 (thanks to
    glenn@physics.su.OZ.AU).

ImageMagick 2.2.3

  o Non-color reduced images were being written even though the color
    reduction option was specified (-colors).  This affected images
    written as AVS, CMYK, and RGB.

  o Modified various sources to reduce lint warnings.


ImageMagick 2.2.2

  o Dithering did not work properly on the Cray (due to right shift
    problem).

  o In most cases dithering requires 1/2 as much memory as previously.

  o Dithering was sped up by ~15%.

  o Occasionally the quantization error was reported incorrectly.


ImageMagick 2.2.1

  o The number of colors reported with the -verbose option was on
    occasion incorrect.

  o Color quantization was improved and in some cases sped up ~10%.

  o Cleaned up image rotation code.

  o Added -shear to mogrify options.

  o Added a file type of HISTOGRAM to convert.

  o Sometimes PBM image files did not have the correct number of
    bytes.

  o Color reduced PPM images were being written at the full color
    resolution.

  o Keypresses are no longer accepted during image configuration.

  o Red, green, and blue values of a X constant image were set to the
    red intensity of the background color.

  o Clipped images did not show up correctly in the panning icon.

  o `animate' no longer shows images out-of-order if the image scene
    number is absent (thanks to kent@oddjob.uchicago.edu).

  o ImageMagick now recognizes the X resource class with the first
    letter of the client capitalized, i.e. 'Display.Visual: default'
    (thanks to dws@ssec.wisc.edu).


ImageMagick 2.2

  o When displaying a composite MIFF image created with `montage',
    button 3 no longer displays a magnify window.  Instead the tile at
    the mouse location is displayed.  When the tile image is exited,
    the composite image reappears.  This is effectively a visual image
    directory.

  o `montage' has a new gravity option for placing an image within
    a tile of the composite, i.e. CenterGravity.

  o `montage' has a new compose option for specifying which composite
     operation to use.

  o `montage' creates composite images with the `montage' keyword.

  o Updated MIFF manual page to reflect 'montage' image header
    keyword.

  o Add -colormap to `mogrify.'  Use to color reduce an image to
    a set of colors you choose.

  o Some compilers have read-only strings.   ImageMagick no longer
    writes on read-only strings.

  o For colormapped X servers, the color reduction has been sped up by
    trading image quality for processing time.  See the README for
    details.

  o Latin1Upper was declared wrong in X.h.

  o Added unistd.h to display.h for strict ANSI compilers.

  o Changed long to time_t for calls to C time routine.

  o Multi-part GIF's can now be displayed or animated.

  o Fixed segmentation fault when reading multi-part images with
    animate, montage, or mogrify.

  o Multi-part MIFF images have the correct file name now.

  o An expose event for the Magnify window may occur before it is
    mapped.  This caused display to fail on Solburne and HP's.

  o Using `-colorspace gray' with 'convert' correctly produces
    grayscale images.

  o Images are sorted by intensity for shared colormapped visuals.
    Some intensity intervals are made "more popular".  This gives
    better image results when sharing colors with other applications.

  o All utilities correctly read multi-part TIFF images.

  o Image pixmap was not being updated correctly when pan icon appears
    (thanks to dws@ssec.wisc.edu).

  o Fixed ANSI warning on image composite code.

  o Panning uses a pixmap for faster panning speed.

  o Rotate.c now uses a table to force range limits.

  o range table in quantize.c is allocated from the heap instead of
    the stack.

  o adjusted the sensitivity for automatic dithering.  Some JPEG images
    were not being dithered.


ImageMagick 2.0

  o Dirk Wetzel <wetzel@forwiss.uni-erlangen.de> fixed the select
    statement in animate.c.

  o Eric Haines <erich@eye.com> fixed ReadRLEImage in decode.c.  It
    previously did not check to see if the background color was present
    in the image.
