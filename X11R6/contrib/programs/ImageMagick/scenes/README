DNA sequence useful for testing the animate(1) program from
contrib/apllications/ImageMagick/ImageMagick-3.0.tar.gz on ftp.x.org.
Animate(1) is a program that can display image sequences on any X
server.  Type:

  make -i
  animate dna.[0-9]*

ImageMagick requires POV to generate the DNA image sequence.
Alternately, you can get the image sequence from
contrib/applications/ImageMagick/ImageMagick.animation.tar.gz on
ftp.x.org.
