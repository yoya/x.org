Release 1.3a, June 5, 1994
    modified copyrights and such to work better with the X11R6 contrib release

    garbage now defaults to "true" rather than "false"

    added Imakefile

Release 1.3, November 15, 1993
    fixed a weird concurrency bug (if you click in the middle of a tick)

    added checks for /var/spool/mail and /var/mail

    fixed bug where MAILDROP didn't work

    fixed beeping (added "flush stdout")

    allowed window to be wider than 80 columns (fills remainder with subject,
    if available)

    automatically scrolls to bottom of list when new mail arrives

Release 1.1, October 19, 1993
    included various command line switches and resources for stuff
    that was already in there

    fixed bug when a mailer removes the spool file rather than truncating it

    changed -bitmap option to no longer require the "@" character

    changed -delay option to take argument in seconds, not milliseconds

    got rid of need to know bitmap width and height

    added -paranoid flag, for some cases where normal file modification
    checking isn't sufficient -- should work better with elm

    added check of env(LOGNAME) in addition to env(USER) -- should
    work better on HP/UX

    added -postageGeometry and -detailGeometry flags

    added -beep option

    changed formatting of details (now, one e-mail per line)

    moved the Dismiss button into upper-right corner

    fixed bug when NFS-mounted e-mail suddenly ceases to exist
    (stale NFS handle)

    made the details window be class "TkPostageDetails"

    remember the detail window's geometry when we close it

    spiffy new Makefile -- no more need to hand-edit tkpostage any more
