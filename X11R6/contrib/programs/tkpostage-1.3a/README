tkpostage is an xbiff-replacement which tells you how many messages
are waiting, and allows you to "quickly" scan the headers -- just click
on the window!  tkpostage is built around the "wish" interpreter of
John Ousterhout's Tcl/Tk system.  You must install "wish" before tkpostage
will run.

To give tkpostage a quick shot, just run "wish -f tkpostage" in this directory.

To install this package, just run "xmkmf" and "make install".  Alternatively,
you can edit Makefile.simple to specify your target directories.

NOTE: TkPostage requires at least Tk3.3 and Tcl7.0, and has been tested
to work fine with later versions through Tk3.6 / Tcl7.3.

Also, if you like to have over 1000 messages in your mail spool, things
may start looking ugly on the user interface.

To see all the options, check out the man page.

=============================================================================
For those who like to compare and contrast Tcl/Tk with Xt programming:

tkpostage version 1.0 consumed 211 lines of Tcl.  xpostage, which does
essentially the same thing, containes 915 lines of C, including 89 lines
which is really just the X bitmap.  So, the Tcl/Tk version is effectively
1/4 the code, while doing all the same things.

Version 1.1 balooned up to 466 lines, adding all the requested features,
and now does significantly more than xpostage ever did.

And, of course, thanks to John Ousterhout for creating Tcl/Tk, without
which I would never have bothered to write this thing.
