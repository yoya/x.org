README for xrunclient
X11R6 contrib version
May 18, 1994


DESCRIPTION

This program launches an X client and waits until it maps a window before
exiting.  It is used in .xinitrc, .openwin-init, or a similar script to
make X startup smoother and less of a drain on system resources.

Here is a sample .xinitrc before xrunclient:

	xrdb -load $HOME/.xresources
	xterm -C -title Console -geometry 80x24+0+0 &
	xsetroot -solid gray &
	xclock -geometry 50x50-0+0 -bw 0 &
	xload -geometry 50x50-50+0 -bw 0 &
	xterm -geometry 80x24+0-0 &
	twm

All the clients try to run at once, so the system thrashes excessively,
and it takes quite a while to settle down and be usable.  (Well, maybe not
with only 4 clients, but if you try to start 20 clients it can be pretty
bad.)

Here is a .xinitrc which uses xrunclient to start the same clients:

	xrdb -load $HOME/.xresources
	xrunclient xterm -C -title Console -geometry 80x24+0+0
	twm &
	xrunclient xsetroot -solid gray
	xrunclient xclock -geometry 50x50-0+0 -bw 0
	xrunclient xload -geometry 50x50-50+0 -bw 0
	xrunclient xterm -geometry 80x24+0-0
	wait

Now each client has a chance to get established before the next one tries
to start.  The console window is usable almost immediately.

Note this is especially helpful if you are trying to run multiple X
terminals from a single compute server.

xrunclient can replace the Sun OpenWindows toolwait program.
