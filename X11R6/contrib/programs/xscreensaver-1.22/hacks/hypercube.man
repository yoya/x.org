hypercube - 2d projection of a 4d object
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hypercube
[\-display \fIhost:display.screen\fP] [\-foreground \fIcolor\fP] [\-background \fIcolor\fP] [\-color[0-7] \fIcolor\fP] [\-xy \fIfloat\fP] [\-xz \fIfloat\fP] [\-yz \fIfloat\fP] [\-xw \fIfloat\fP] [\-yw \fIfloat\fP] [\-zw \fIfloat\fP] [\-observer-z \fIint\fP] [\-window] [\-root] [\-mono] [\-delay \fIusecs\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIhypercube\fP program displays a wireframe projection of a hypercube
which is rotating at user-specified rates around any or all of its four axes.
.SH OPTIONS
.I hypercube
accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B \-window
Draw on a newly-created window.  This is the default.
.TP 8
.B \-root
Draw on the root window.
.TP 8
.B \-mono 
If on a color display, pretend we're on a monochrome display.
.TP 8
.B \-delay microseconds
How much of a delay should be introduced between steps of the animation.
Default 100000, or about 1/10th second.
.TP 8
.B \-observer-z int
How far away the observer is from the center of the cube (the cube is one
unit per side.)  Default 5.
.TP 8
.B \-color0 color
.TP 8
.B \-color1 color
.TP 8
.B \-color2 color
.TP 8
.B \-color3 color
.TP 8
.B \-color4 color
.TP 8
.B \-color5 color
.TP 8
.B \-color6 color
.TP 8
.B \-color7 color
The colors used to draw the line segments bordering the eight faces of
the cube.  Some of the faces have only two of their border-lines drawn in
the specified color, and some have all four.
.TP 8
.B \-xw float
.TP 8
.B \-xy float
.TP 8
.B \-xz float
.TP 8
.B \-yw float
.TP 8
.B \-yz float
.TP 8
.B \-zw float
The amount that the cube should be rotated around the specified axis at
each frame of the animation, expressed in radians.  These should be small
floating-point values (less than 0.05 works best.)  Default: xy=0.01,
xz=0.005, yw=0.01.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.TP 8
.B DISPLAY
to get the default host and display number.
.TP 8
.B XENVIRONMENT
to get the name of a resource file that overrides the global resources
stored in the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.
