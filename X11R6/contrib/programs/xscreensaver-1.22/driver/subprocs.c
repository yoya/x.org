/* I would really like some error messages to show up on the screensaver window
   itself when subprocs die, or when we can't launch them.  If the process
   produces output, but does not actually die, I would like that output to go
   to the appropriate stdout/stderr as they do now.  X and Unix conspire to
   make this incredibly difficult.

   - Not all systems have SIGIO, so we can't necessarily be signalled when a
     process dies, so we'd have to poll it with wait() or something awful like
     that, which would mean the main thread waking up more often than it does
     now.

   - We can't tell the difference between a process dying, and a process not
     being launched correctly (for example, not being on $PATH) partly because
     of the contortions we need to go through with /bin/sh in order to launch
     it.

   - We can't do X stuff from signal handlers, so we'd need to set a flag, 
     save the error message, and notice that flag in the main thread.  The
     problem is that the main thread is probably sleeping, waiting for the 
     next X event, so to do this we'd have to register a pipe FD or something,
     and write to it when something loses.

   - We could assume that any output produced by a subproc indicates an error,
     and blast that across the screen.  This means we'd need to use popen()
     instead of forking and execing /bin/sh to run it for us.  Possibly this
     would work, but see comment in exec_screenhack() about getting pids.
     I think we could do the "exec " trick with popen() but would SIGIO get
     delivered correctly?  Who knows.  (We could register the pipe-FD with
     Xt, and handle output on it with a callback.)

   - For the simple case of the programs not being on $PATH, we could just 
     search $PATH before launching the shell, but that seems hardly worth the
     effort...  And it's broken!!  Why should we have to duplicate half the
     work of the shell?  (Because it's Unix, that's why!  Bend over.)

     - I want to spawn a process.
     - I want to know it's pid so that I can kill it.
     - I would like to receive a message when it dies of natural causes.
     - I want the spawned process to have user-specified arguments.

     The *only way* to parse arguments the way the shells do is to run a
     shell (or duplicate what they do, which would be a *lot* of code.)

     The *only way* to know the pid of the process is to fork() and exec()
     it in the spawned side of the fork.

     But if you're running a shell to parse your arguments, this gives you
     the pid of the SHELL, not the pid of the PROCESS that you're actually
     interested in, which is an *inferior* of the shell.  This also means
     that the SIGCHLD you get applies to the shell, not its inferior.

     So, the only solution other than implementing an argument parser here
     is to force the shell to exec() its inferior.  What a fucking hack!
     We prepend "exec " to the command string.

     (Actually, Clint Wong <clint@jts.com> points out that process groups
     might be used to take care of this problem; this may be worth considering
     some day, except that, 1: this code works now, so why fix it, and 2: from
     what I've seen in Emacs, dealing with process groups isn't especially
     portable.)
