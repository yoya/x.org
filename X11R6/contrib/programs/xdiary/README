Xdiary version 1.1 -- An X application that displays a one month calendar or a
                      full year calendar and/or an interactive daily diary.

Xdiary is a simple tool for associating text with a specific date, useful for
keeping a daily diary or work log.  By using templates, the diary entries can
be configured or personalized to be suitabile for a wide range of needs.
Several languages are also supported.  See the xdiary man page for details.

Xdiary is now written completely in ANSI C, without any attempt to be backward
compatible with K&R C compilers.  To build xdiary, first run "xmkmf" in the
xdiary directory.  Then type "make".

Xdiary was developed and tested on Harris Night Hawk 4000 and 5000 systems,
running Harris' CX/RT real-time operating system.  It has been tested with R6
on an NCR 3445 running NCR SVR4.0 MP (Thanks to Garry Paxinos at Metrolink).

Xdiary was written by Jason Baietto (Jason.Baietto@mail.csd.harris.com).
Version 1.0 originally appeared for X11 R4 in late 1990.  Version 1.1 is
basically a cleaned up version with a slightly better GUI for X11 R6.

A large part of the xdiary coding effort was devoted to the CalendarWidget in
hopes that other developers might use it in their own applications.  See the
Cal.ps document for more information on using the CalendarWidget.

Thanks are due to Chela Diaz de Villegas, Theresia Buesser, Joel Brogniart,
Erwan David, Thilo Gramlich, Vasco Lopes Paulo, John T. McCranie and Silvio
Bichisecchi for help with the multiple language support.  Many thanks also to
Jim Burmeister for GUI and documentation guidance.
