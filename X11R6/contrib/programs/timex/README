NAME: Timex
AUTHOR: Harald Tveit Alvestrand, UNINETT <harald.t.alvestrand@uninett.no>
COPYRIGHT: Like the X11R6 copyright

Timex is an Athena Widget-based program to keep track of time.
It puts up a list of projects, and the number of minutes worked on each.
You click on the project you want to work on, and it starts counting on that.
At the end of the day, it saves the collected data in a file, and you can
use a script to process the data. "sumtimex" is one possible such script.

There are a couple of man pages floating around.

Whatever you do about it, please tell me.

INSTALLATION

If you are lucky:

1) Unshar/untar the software. It untars into the current directory.

2) Inspect the imakefile. You may want to change NONXBINDIR and PERLLIBDIR.

3) % xmkmf
   This creates a makefile configured for *your* system.
   I'm almost certain the included one will bite you.

4) % make

5) % make test
   This takes Timex for a "test ride", using the directory "test.timex"
   in the current directory.

6) (as root) # make install

7) (as yourself) % Create a directory called .timex in your homedir

8) % timex (or xtimex, if you think that timex is a system command)

If you are unlucky, mumble.
If you find out why you are unlucky, send me an E-mail about it.

Tested on a lot of platforms, thanks to the beta test corps (you know
who you are, THANKS!):

- Sun3/SunOS
- Sun4/SunOS
- SCO Unix
- VAX/VMS
- DECstation/UNIX
- SGI Indigo
- Apollo DN3000 and DN4000
- HP 400 series
- HP 700 series
- IBM RISC System6000/AIX
- ESV Workstation
- Linux

If you have a platform not on this list, you are welcome to join the
beta tester corps! Write timex-beta-request@uninett.no to get on the list.

NOTE:

As distributed, Timex will send an UDP packet to my workstation every
time it is started, containing your (numeric) UID, your operating
system and the Timex version.

This is JUST because I would like to get an idea of how many people
use Timex, and keep on using it (rather than "tried it once" folks).
It will NEVER become a licensing scheme or some crazy thing like that.
But, if your netadmins hate unknown UDP packets zooming off to unknown
hosts, simply uncomment the following line to the IMAKEFILE:

   CDEBUGFLAGS = -DDO_NOT_TELL_ABOUT_ME

This will not only stop the call, but will drop the whole content of
udping.c, which will also block any errors caused by differences in
the socket implementation.


COPYING, PAYMENT AND SUCH DETAILS

I wrote this program because I needed it. After I released the first
version, I got the feeling that other people may need it too.

This particular version is distributed under the same copyright as
X11R6, that is:

     Copyright (c) 1994 Harald T. Alvestrand

     The X Consortium, and any party obtaining a copy of these files from
     the X Consortium, directly or indirectly, is granted, free of charge, a
     full and unrestricted irrevocable, world-wide, paid up, royalty-free,
     nonexclusive right and license to deal in this software and
     documentation files (the "Software"), including without limitation the
     rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense,
     and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons who receive
     copies from any such party to do so.  This license includes without
     limitation a license to do the foregoing actions under any patents of
     the party supplying this software to the X Consortium.
 
As usual, there is no guarantee about anything at all, and you are not able
to claim that I have done any damage to you by providing you with this
program; any use you make of it is entirely at your own risk.

If you like it, I would be happy if you would do one of the following
things:

- Leave the UDP packet sending ON, so that I can get a warm, fuzzy feeling
  from seeing that it is used on the Internet

- Send me a postcard with a nice stamp for my daughter's stamp collection

- Contribute the cost of a large pizza (my favourite costs around
  NOK 120 / USD 20 around Trondheim) to help my family feel that all the
  time I spent doing this made some sense. (So far, 2 people have done this)

MAILING LISTS

A lot of people have found bugs in Timex. A lot of people are interested
in further versions, suggestions for new ways to use it and so on.
A few are even willing to do some work to help me test it.

So, I have two mailing lists set up:

   timex@uninett.no: For general interest
                     Mail timex-request@uninett.no to join.
                    
   timex-beta@uninett.no: For testing new versions before I inflict them
                     upon the unwary public.
                     Mail timex-beta-request@uninett.no to join.

New versions are ONLY announced on these lists.

CONTRIBUTORS

Bob Gibson <rjg@sco.com> contributed signal handling.
Taed Nelson <nelson@berlioz.nsc.com> contributed the pause button.
Bruce Steinke <bsteinke@dsd.es.com> contributed the project editor,
      easiest the biggest patch I got!
      He would not recognize the current version, but thanks anyway!
George Carrette <gjc@mitec5.mitech.com> contributed the VMS stuff.
      It is supposed to work on VMS now.
Michael J. Shon <mjs@tropel.gca.com> contributed the TIMEXDIR variable.
Mark Rawling <Mark.Rawling@mel.dit.csiro.au> contributed the code
      for displaying the project and used time in the icon name.
Bill Randle <billr@saab.cna.tek.com> made the first icon for timex,
      and gave me code to produce an icon. Sorry it took so long!
      He also contributed the -minutes and -monthday options to sumtimex.
Grant Totten <ccgwt@blaze.trentu.ca> supplied the current Timex icon.
Mike Gleichner <mkg@stealth.plk.af.mil> made it run on a NEXT
Shane Youl <Shane.Youl@mel.dit.csiro.au> supplied the first multilingual
      version of sumtimex, and most of the non-English, non-Norwegian
      strings.
Gilles Goullet <Gilles.GOULLET@iacorp.fr> supplied some more French
      for the multilingual ability
Per Hallenborg <hbg@vattenfall.se> contributed Swedish text for Sumtimex.
Gordon Berkley <gordonb@mcil.comm.mot.com> supplied the "ad2c" script.

Too many people to list them all pointed out elementary errors in my code
and gave hints for increasing portability.

NOTE FOR PEOPLE SUPPLYING PATCHES:

If you use the "make indent" target in the Makefile to line things up
the way I like it, there is a better chance that I will include your
patch verbatim rather than going off on a different track.
My favourite indents are listed in the .indent.pro file.
