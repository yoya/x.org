This list has 3 sections: One for bugs to be fixed, one for features
to be added, one for things that someone may like.

Last updated: Version 1.92 Beta

KNOWN BUGS
- The resizing does not work right when adding/deleting projects.
- Empty projects should have time displayed as 0:00 when highlighted
  (this is needed when zeroing a project)

FEATURES THAT MAY BE ADDED BEFORE RELEASE 2.00
- Warning when leaving edit-mode timex without saving
  (or perhaps one should just autosave)
- Support for delete WindowManager protocol
- Fallback resources that make *some* sense
- X resources for a few more hardcoded changes
  (like the number of hours the scrollbar covers)
- A man page for "sumtimex"
- Change "paused" mode to be an integer, giving project number
  (0=paused, 1-n=this project) (Ken Butler's idea)
- Automagical creation of the .timex directory

WISH LIST

- Someone would like hierarchical projects (some projects pop up windows
  that let you select subprojects)
- Configure which buttons that appear in the command box
- A history log of when projects were clicked/changed (some dislike this....)
- I would like to put bars across the scrollbar at every hour division.
- Max no of minutes in scrollbar should be settable
- Checking to see that you don't attempt to do > 24 hours in a day
- Sumtimex option to *not* add to certain projects with -adjust option
- Calendar-like widget for selecting a day to edit
- Interactive removal of lock file

I also have about four miles of patches that turn timex into the
centrepiece of a task tracking and overtime budgeting system - or
something like that; I do NOT think I will be able to fit all that
into Timex any time soon, unfortunately.
