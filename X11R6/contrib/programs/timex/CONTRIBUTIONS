CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE AUTHOR OF TIMEX
====================================

Making Timex was fun.
Seeing that people use it was also fun.
Maintaining it is nice, too.

So, if you don't feel like sending me anything, DON'T DO IT.

Otherwise, I feel that a contribution on the order of a large pizza
(NOK 120, USD 20) would be about the right order of magnitude for a
happy user. Multiply by number of users and divide by degree of
happiness until you have a number you feel comfortable with.

Unfortunately, moving money across the world may be easy, but not
cheap. My local bank says the following magic words will get me money:

  Account 4200.11.71938 Harald Tveit Alvestrand
  Bank name Sparebanken Midt-Norge, SWIFT code SPTRNO22
  Sender can pay all transfer charges

The fee will vary from approx USD 7 to USD 14, depending on what kind
of transfer you use. In some cases, I will have to pay the bank in
order to get the money, too.

The charge is about the same for any sum up to approx USD 150.000, which
means that sending a hat around the office before sending is a good idea.

I would enjoy some return on the time I've spent on Timex.
But I wanted to make clear to you exactly how much you must spend in
order to get it to me.

Make your own decisions - if you manage to get some money through, it
will bring a smile to my face!
