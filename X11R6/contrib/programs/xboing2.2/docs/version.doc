Have fun with the newest version of XBoing. Here are some new features :-

- Comprehensive point and click WYSIWYG level editor.
    - Play test mode.
    - Flip & scroll of blocks in editor.
    - Name, time limit settings.
    - Easy method for level design.
- Sound system improved with more support.
- Lots of really cool new sound effects.
- Better presentation ie: more intro screens.
- Level preview in the introduction sequence.
- Load and save of games when allowed.
- Game play changed to be fairer and more interesting.
- More sound system support.
- Levels have been re-designed.
- Several new blocks and other creatures.
- Source code has been improved and is neater.
- Imakefile worked on again.
- Some really bad bugs have been squashed.
- Some new command line options.
- Several CHEAT methods terminated!
- Dual fire for paddle.
- Use of dialogue boxes for some things.
- Works with XPM version 3.4.

The level editor is fully functional. The only problem will be when the game
is installed properly and the levels are placed somewhere where the average
user cannot edit them. You will also have a locking problem on them.

Later versions of xboing will have a file selector or something. Maybe :)

For more detail consult the changes.doc file in the source code. It has a
blow by blow description of all changes for this version.
