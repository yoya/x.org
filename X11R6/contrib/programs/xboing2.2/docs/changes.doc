Version 2.1 - 2nd June 1994 (Current)
-------------------------------------

- Version number changed.
- Submitted for X11R6 inclusion in the contrib section.


Version 2.1 - 30th May 1994
---------------------------

- Fixed small bug in SUNaudio.c so it compiles on SVR4.
- Added some fancy headings to the READMES and the high score printout to
  stdout.
- Changed the level bonus from 1000 to 100 so scores don't get too high! :-)
- Added a patch to the timing code ms_sleep is now usleep. Thanks to 
  Pierre Didierjean <cisitm@nyassa.cad.cea.fr>
- FIXED THE FAMOUS NEVER ENDING LEVEL BUG WITH GREAT THANKS TO :-
  Christian Brechbuehler <brech@vision.ee.ethz.ch> who provided the fix!!
- Fiddled with the distribution again making it more R6 compliant.
- Added some more sound effects.
- Changed the copyright notice so that I can include it in R6 Contrib for MIT.
- Changed all filenames so the pass the checktree test for X11R6 - phew :(
  MS-DOS and the CD-ROM format have a lot to answer for. Long filenames are far
  better.
- Replaced some sounds that needed to be resampled to 8000Hz. Thanks goes to
  marvo@asl.uni-bielefeld.de.
- Better portable version of usleep() suggested from Mike Campbell 
  mlcampb1@mikec.b30.ingr.com.


Version 2.0 - 9th March 1994 
----------------------------

- Seems as though the bug with nothing left and still playing is still there.
- In the bonuses screen the scores displayed such as a SUPER_BONUS are also
  adjusted to the score so it seems correct when all is added up.
- BorderGlow was missing from the demo screen.
- Added some more text to the instructions in a smaller font.
- Added a USE_RPLAY define to Imakefile. thanks R.K.Lloyd again.
- Sorry - I have to remove the function prototype for system calls as I have
  millions of people giving me different ones for different systems.
- Took out the handicap based on game speed. Maybe make it based on your rank.
- Added the earth pixmap to the high scores.
- Added a -noicon option that turns off the custom icon.
- Fixed bug where ball debris was left over when hitting a death symbol.
- I have removed some of the brighter backgrounds so that they don't hide the
  blocks as much. Only 3 gone. Frees up some colours too!
- Placed all file reading writing stuff for levels in file.c
- I now have SGIaudio.c thanks to Aage Nymark <Age.Nymark@termo.unit.no> and it
  plays the .au files nicely.
- Possibly fixed endless level bug - patch sent to comp.windows.x - waiting
  for the results to flow in!
- Poeple cheating with bonus screen being redrawed after iconifying screen.!
- Only adds a x2bonus or x4bonus if it isn't already active. It is silly to
  have a x2 bonus come up if the scoring is already x2.
- Changed the border width to 2 pixels - looks better - not so chunky.
- Added a preview screen that will randomly choose a level and display the
  block setup for you. It is found after the highscores.
- Fixed the randomise code for the ball tilt to be multi directional.
- Added a dynamite block that will explode all other blocks of the type
  the dynamite lands on. Randomly choosen and random appearance.

  pixmaps for the dialogue box.
- Inserted a header into the highscore file so I can check versions of it
  etc. The boing master can now save some wicked text with the highscores.
- Made the dialogue modal and return a string. What an effort!!!!
- Put some code into the dialogue so it can validate the type of input.
- Added a set starting level for game input dialogue. You can set the level
  via the in game system.
- A new version of AFaudio has been sent in by Wes Whitnah 
  <wesw@orca.wv.tek.com> who has been working on it. It is called AFaudioV2.c
  and will replace the old one when it is confirmed by others that it works.
- A new version of LINUXaudio has been sent in by David W. Boyd, 
  <dave_boyd@Sterling.com> who has been working on that too. Please email me
  if it works and I will replace the old version.
- Added save and load facilities for games. Made quite a few new functions
  in lots of places for level.c file.c where globals are set and returned
  through functions - better code.
- Made the FreeBlocksPixmap() code also free all regions in blocks array.
- Started a maintenance manual that is called README.maintain
- Moved all bitmaps into directories under the bitmaps directory to make the
  bitmaps directory a tad smaller.

- Still working on level editor.
- Added flip and scroll of levels in editor for both x and y.
- Added a play test mode to the editor. Minimal changes to other code.
- Updated the manual for the level editor.
- Fixed up the includes to have -I in Imakefile and changed all source to 
  reflect this.
- All I have to do is change patchlevel.h now to update copyright message!
- Added a yes/no class to the dialogue. If (YesNoDialogue(display, message)) {}
- Added the II to the presents screen just under XBOING meaning version 2.
- Made the right mouse button = hitpoints display on block for editor.
- Due to AIcons V1.5 there is a README for copyright restrictions on some of
  the backgrounds I have used from AIcons which was from somewhere else.
- All sound files are now in the sounds directory under audio. Better if you
  want to delete all sound related stuff.
- Fixed the bug in the maximum volume setting.
- When the editor expands the main window it also sets the size hints so you
  cannot resize it. It will also change them back when you quit the editor.
- I have added some html files that can be used via XMosaic for example.
- When a ball cannot teleport as there is no where to go it will teleport to 
  the paddle and shoot off there.
- Did a bit of house keeping on all files.
- No maximum number of lives - only MAX_LIVES will be shown that's all.
- Tried to fix the reverse control but I am finding it hard.


Version 1.8 - 2nd November 1993
---------------------------------

- I cannot believe how many people emailed me over the earth_xpm corrupt
  problem when the program even says to read the README.problems. What do
  I have to do to make people read it before emailing me!!! Argghh!!

  defines etc to the lock routine and defined my own lock defines. This makes
  it easier than before. You can now turn off locking all together in the
  Imakefile.
- I missed a few ntohl() calls in highscore code that barfed on Linux thanks to 
  <Thomas Pundt> pundtt@uni-muenster.de
- Autotilt bug fixed thanks to Jelle van Zeijl jvzeijl@isosa1.estec.esa.nl
- Changed the variable called index into j as it causes problems with index()!!

- Added a nickname feature where the name given is used instead in the high
  score file instead of your real name. Suggested: Christian Goeller.
- Took out LinkFile() in Imakefile as it wasn't know buy some imake versions.
  I replaced it with what it actually does!
- Changed RenderShape() to use clip masks as it seems to be quicker and use
  less memory in that I don't need a buffer for drawing. Thanks to
  Clement Gray Taylor <clem@bach.udel.edu> for the idea.
- Added mode_quit to the pause loop to stop frame inc when in quit mode.
  Thanks to goldsman@scratchy.gtri.gatech.edu (Michael G. Goldsman)
- Removed all ansi trigraphs from the earth.xpm file. I hope!
- Added some DEBUG() statements around the traps.
- Added the audio file to the -setup option to suss out what sound system
  you will be using as it is possible to be using either rplay, netaudio or
  SUNaudio if you are on a Sparc for example.

  Thanks for that - maybe the Linux author could look at this code so that
  you guys can have click free audio?
- Fixed a small bug in the clear routine in the presents code.
- Fixed a small bug in the finish code of the highscore where it waited for
  a while before changing slides.
- Added a quit current game question y/n so you don't stuff up by accident.
- Fixed the quit game function to be exit game.
- Tested for scores over 1000000 and no bug found?? Some poeple have bugs?
- Bonus coins issued only when timer is positive, he he
- The cursor now has a few modes and shapes. Also fixed a memory leak in the
  cursor code where the cursors were not being freed.
- To get back into the feel of a game I changed the Press space to start text
  to the old "Insert coin to start game." phrase. :-)
- Added some dropping blocks. They slowly fall down the screen. They have rand
  speeds and will not clobber an existing block.

  place bumping into things. He/she just wanders around making it hard to hit
  them. he he - I like this dude!
- Fixed the little redraw bug when paddle changes size. Removed the backing 
  store stuff in paddle code.
- Added a shot direction finder that allows you to select the angle to shoot
  the ball at when starting a new ball. Pretty neat but what a mess to do.
  It now works. Cool.
- Added an ouch.au file to the smiley roamer faces when hit.
- Added ball collision so that when more than 1 ball is active it will hit
  and bounce off the other in a good way. Thanks to Oyvind Yrke

- New balls from multiball are randomly teleported and vel is randomised.
- Removed a  few functions in ball.c that were never called!!!!

- Cannot shoot your ball as it is being created. I think.
- Made the copyright notice more complete.
- Made the highscore file save the real user id and use that for the comparing
  when updating the highscore file so all those cheats out there cannot chfn
  and get in the global highscore file more than once :-)
- Updated troubleshooting in INSTALL.
- Added the network to long stuff to all the entries in highscore table that
  are bigger than 1 char.

- NULL terminated the string returned form strftime() function in highscore.c
- Added some new backgrounds from Anthony's Icons Volume 1.3.
- Killed of the spin.au file as it kills the audio for some reason - put
  a new one in called intro.au that is a powerdown sound.
- All buttons now shoot bullets in game mode. Also the button starts of the
  ball instead of the space bar now.

  network independent conversion of the score and level. May now work over
  networks where the machine has different byte ordering for score file only.
- Added a killer mode where the ball turns red and the ball goes through all
  blocks like butter. It is activated after 10 bonuses have been collected.
- Only real errors now get written to stderr - all others to stdout.

- Now displays how many bonuses you have during level.
- Plays sound when touching a block
- Added 3 env variables for the highscore file, levels dir, and sounds dir so
  that you can change them to point to your own cheat level files!!

- Following changes provided by :-
   - Jean Yves VIONDURY (viondury@mururoa.imag.fr) and
     Olivier DUMAS (dumas@mururoa.imag.fr) from Bull-IMAG, France.

    . The ball bounce on the paddle has been modified, so that the ball can
      be oriented better than before.
    . The autotilt-random function has been changed, to make the auto-tilt
      function more reliable.
    . Speed modifiers due to Warp values now propose a linear evolution.
    . The global high score file is locked when updated, to avoid conflicts
      and score losses when several people finish their game at the same time.
      This feature hasn't been extensively tested, as these situations aren't
      easy to provoke. But we rely on the system to make it work properly.

- You will all notice the improved ball bouncing off the paddle thanks to the
  above dudes. Thanks again.
- Thanks to christos@deshaw.com for the patch on alt.sources regarding the
  extra error cases in error.c and the ansi trigraphs bug.
- Supports HP audio which I think is .au format as well on the device.
- Discovered the UNOFFFICIAL patch on export. Hmm - don't like the flag change!
- Sent a patch by soulard@corto.inria.fr that fixes the problem where the
  teleport can have problems when it puts the ball in an enclosed area. Thanks.
- Added a paddle shrink and expand block - removed paddlesize getting smaller
  as you get higher in the levels as it is too hard.
- Added README's in all subdirectories. Cleaned up code and directory.


Version 1.5 - 23rd July 1993
----------------------------

- Thanks for all the responses :-) I think I better post it to news!
  Our machine is slowwwwwing down from all those ftpers! I asked for it!
- After first posting I received quite a few mail messages about the
  Imakefile and compiling on other machines. Well I never said it would
  so I have now added the patches/suggestions.
- The semicolin missing was unfortunate. I use gcc by default and that
  of course didn't need that line of code. Sorry folks.
- Colourmap problems - well I did warn that it only works for colour!
  I'll try to get it to work for greyscale - XPM handles it but the
  pixmaps look bad as they were designed for colour only. Sorry.
- I forgot a manual page - Done. Please forgive me if it is pox as it is
  my first go at nroff.
- Updated the Imakefile more to include the directory installation.
- A few lose ends in highscore.c fixed. Also took some useless stuff out of
  the Imakefile.
- Added a pirate block that will kill the ball when hit. You can shoot the
  pirate 3 times and lose 1000 points, saves your ball though.
- Fixed the bullet bug where sometimes on a new level you couldn't shoot
  even if you had bags of ammo.
- Displays level name when starting.
- The way bonuses are added is much better now. Less time wasting.
- Turned off the graphics exposures in the graphics contexts to speed the
  while event loop up considerably. Wow, what a difference.
- Added the timer and special bonus area after squashing the message area
  smaller. This area will have a count down timer and special modes will be
  indicated in the special area. The bonus screen now uses the timer bonus.
- Added TrueColour to the colour test for all those SGI people.
- Added tink code to clear off tinks.
- Improvement for the bullet/ball collision.
- Added an I key for quick Iconification if the boss walks passed.
- Added a -scores option to print highscores to command line.
- If the user has a '&' in their gecos it should be expanded to their user
  name and then the first letter upper case. Patch by jeff@rd1.interlan.com
- Better parsing of level data. Time bonus is now part of level data.
- Fixed major ball debris bug. Easy - clear background before copying it for
  the backing store. Also done for the paddle/bullet. However, I must fix the 
  collision detection though. Sometimes a bit of a block is cut out. :-(
- Added code so that when the ball get stuck in a loop, if the paddle is not
  hit in n seconds then the board will auto tilt.
- Put code in to time the game and show up in highscore table.
  Updated both the X bit and commandline bit.
- Fiddled with the timing routines. Still a bit dodgy.
- Made some calls in highscore table better and to use misc routines.
- The ball collision detection now uses regions that get created as the block
  is created. This is better than a whole lot of if's if you ask me.
- Also fixed the addbonus code and made a MakeBlockGeometry function to
  make code more modular.
- Added a personal highscore feature. Your highscores get saved to a highscore
  file in your home directory.
- Took out the beep if the key isn't recognisied. Started shitting me!!
- Install procedure finally fixed. yeah.
- Made the mouse move the paddle relative to it's position. Asked for a lot.
- Also a new commandline option [-keys] will disable the mouse mode and only
  allow keys to move the paddle. This is better than having both.
- Added a reverse block - when hit the controls reverse for a time span.
- The highscore file is now always fchmod()ed to make sure permissions are
  correct for all players.
- Added a hyperspace block that will turn off the side wall for the
  ball and it will wrap around as such.
- Fixed the text routine calls in intro.c to use calls in misc.c
- Added SUN audio - yeah yeah yeah again.... -sound option for audio.
- Fixed the Imakefile to use the audio settings and how to find sounds.
- Added some sound effects. More later.
- Added code to highlight the score you just obtained in a game in highscore.
- Adjusted the code in bonus.c to allow the space to pressed to skip bonus
  animations but still add the bonus score onto the score etc.
- Add the specials display at bottom of the window indicating the current
  specials mode.
- Added another 10 levels to make a total of 40 levels. It is rather boring
  creating levels :-)
- Added a ball kill key <d>.
- Highscores are saved when quitting with q key.
- Redesigned the keys screen - added a = audio on/off g = game control
  added 1-9 for speed control
- Added an extra ball animation and block.
- Changed the ball slightly so that it has a white circle around it so it will
  stand out better on all backgrounds.
- Cursor is now gone and grabbed to main window.
- Added applause sound when level is finished.
- Found a bad bug in FreeBlocks() or something. Cool. fixes -static bug.
- The gun.c code is re-written so you can shoot more than 1 bullet at a time
  making a machine gun effect. Really cool!!
- Added the maching gun block. It now lasts for a whole level.
- Removed the fore/background colours for gcand to init.c instead of being
  in the misc.c code - reduces the rendershape routine down by 2 calls.
- Took out the backgrounds that were complicated and guady. 4 of them
- Added a walls off block
- Added a teleport block and it works.
- Audio can now be toggled on or off while playing game. a key
- Added the -setup option so sysops can find out whats going on.
- Removed the sideways level off on scrolling.
- Took out a few shitty things.
- Added the presenting screen and all its quirks. More sounds!
- Added a random block that changes colour every now and then.
- Fixed the event loops so that when it is iconified it uses hardly and cpu
  and is much better on the system. Almost dissapears of top!
- Added multi ball mode - what a change!! Anyway up to six balls can now
  bounce around causing havoc!
- Added sticky paddle block and mode - ball sticks to paddle and requires you
  to shoot it off again.
- Added some neat sound effects - sorry for the voice ones but I am no sound
  expert! :-)
- I think I have removed the flash before the window appears.
- Fixed they way the blocks explode after a bomb block.
- Pause is now more friendly to the system like iconify is.
- added a x2 and x4 bonus as well as fixing the old bonus code.
- Fixed the kill ball routine to work for multi balls - kill first in array.
- Made the x2 x4 turn off for each dead ball.
- You can now shoot some of the specials and get rid of them (3 times)
- Changed the way the ball checks for collisions - works well now - no
  left overs and few muck ups. Cool - at last.
- Manual page update - install updated - readme updated - Imakefile updated
- Fixed a few little bugs - cannot use escape in bonus mode 

Version 1.4/1.0 BETA
--------------------

- Under developement, no time for notes. ;-)
