These source files are used in the X11 game called xboing. 

"I" have only tested the SUNaudio.c so I cannot verify the other code, however,
several other people on the net have tested it on their machines. Thanks for
all those people who have sent me code to play sound on their machine type.

The sound code will only play .au Sun audio format files or treat them as a
binary raw audio file - may click a bit on playing with some setups.

Please email the authors of the sound files as they wrote them. I am no
expert on PC SoundBlaster support for example.

PS: If you have sound and have successfully used it in xboing then email me
	and let me know if it was a hassle and if any files need to be changed
	to reduce warnings errors etc.

I would like to improve the SGI audio so that the code is not so nasty on the
audio device closing it/opening it to clear a sound!

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS TO SOUND PLAYERS
====================================

- Please do not remove any stubs that you think are not useful. They are there
  so my header files don't complain.
- Try to keep to 4 tabs and the current style as I am trying to maintain the
  code to look all the same. Use expand -4 to change tabs to 4 spaces.
- Thanks to all those working on the sound support.
