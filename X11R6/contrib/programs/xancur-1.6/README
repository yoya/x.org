                    xancur (ksan'ker) version 1.6

-----------------------------------------------------------README

NAME
     xancur - root cursor animation program for X

SYNOPSIS
     xancur [-help] [-display display] [-usleep microseconds]  [-
     fg  color]  [-bg  color]  [-rv]  [-script scriptname] [-iter
     iterations] [cursorfile maskfile]...

DESCRIPTION
     The xancur program allows the user to animate the background
     ("root")  cursor  on  a workstation display running X.  Nor-
     mally, one experiments with xancur until one finds a  pleas-
     ing,  personalized  look,  then puts the xancur command that
     produces it into an X  startup  file.   If  no  options  are
     specified,  xancur  will  attempt to read a scriptfile named
     .xancur  in  the  user's  home  directory  for  a  list   of
     cursor/mask filenames.

This program has been provided with both Imakefiles and example Makefiles
for those not succeeding in the use of imake.  As supplied, the default
compiler in the Makefiles *may* be the GNU CC compiler "gcc".

Makefiles can be compiled from Imakefiles with the following command,
commonly installed in well-run X installations to prevent users from
having to work out the details themselves:

	xmkmf

An example Makefile, Makefile.dst, has been provided.  The following
command may succeed in the event that xmkmf(1) fails:

	make Makefile

If either case succeeds, follow with

	make Makefiles

The next stage, of course, is

	make

Test the resulting binary with

	xancur -script Script

Finally, you can finish up with

	make install

The Imakefiles can be edited to change the location of the default
animated cursor by changing the following lines as desired.  Note that
$(LIBDIR) refers to the macro from the imake template files for X11.
The same lines may be edited in the Makefiles.

      XANCURDIR = $(LIBDIR)/xancur
    STD_DEFINES = -DXANCUR_SCRIPT=\"$(XANCURDIR)/Script\"

This software was originally developed on a Sun 3/150 workstation using
SunOS 4.0.3, GNU Emacs 18.52, GNU GCC 1.37.1, GNU GDB 3.4, X11R4, and the
``smooth'' font "-Talisman-Smooth-Bold-R-Normal--12-120-80-80-C-76-None-1".
Further work was done on a SPARCstation 1+ running SunOS 4.1 .

...then later improved and a Sun SPARCstation 10 running SunOS 4.1.3, GNU
Emacs 19.24, GCC 2.5.8, and X11R6.

Have a nice day :-)
