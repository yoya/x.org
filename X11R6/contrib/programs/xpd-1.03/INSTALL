1)  If you have a correctly installed imake, simply type 

    ~X11/bin/xmkmf -a

    and watch imake do its thing.  Otherwise, you will have to hack the 
    Makefile.sun to appropriately configure xpd for your system.  Note that
    the current program will NOT run on Sparc systems with OpenWindows
    2.0 or above as not all necessary X libraries are present.

2)  make all

3)  If there aren't any errors, run make -n install.  If you are satisfied
    with where it is going to install, run make install.   This will install
    the executable and application defaults file (the application defaults  
    file must be installed or in a directory referenced by XAPPLRESDIR).

4)  Run make install.man to install the man page.

5)  Note that  the Makefile will automatically set ownership of xpd in the 
    ~X11/bin directory as root with the setuid bit turned on.  If you do NOT
    want a setuid program in that directory, simply execute the following
    commands as root:

        chmod u-s ~X11/bin/xpd
        chgrp kmem ~X11/bin/xpd
        chmod g+s ~X11/bin/xpd

    since xpd MUST have the setgid bit on as group kmem to read kernel data
    (for systems other than Suns, modify the group as appropriate).
