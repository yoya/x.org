xlax is a program that allows output to
be sent to several windows (via SendEvent()).

It can be useful for some tasks that require almost
the same thing to be done on different machines.

Bugs: Send questions, comments or whatever to 
frank@cis.ohio-state.edu.

Author: Frank Adelstein, with code for window selection
taken from "dsimple" in MIT clients, and "vroot.h" used
so it'll work under tvtwm.

Platforms: It's been tested on SunOS 4.1.3 platforms 
and HPs (it's been so long I'm not sure if they were 700s or not).

Standard X copying policies apply (see the copyright notice
at the beginning of code for full details).
