XDU - Display the output of "du" in an X window
================================================================

XDU is a program for displaying a graphical tree of disk space
utilization as reported by the UNIX utility "du".  You can
navigate up and down in the tree, sort things, and print out
information.  See the manual page for details.

This program can be found by anonymous ftp at

	ftp.arl.mil:pub/xdu-3.0.tar.Z

and should appear in the X11R6 contrib files.

================================================================
Compilation
================================================================

Use "xmkmf" to build a Makefile from the Imakefile.
Then "make", "make install", "make install.man".
But if for some reason you can't do that, try:

	cc -o xdu xdu.c xwin.c -lXaw -lXt -lXext -lX11

See the XDu.ad file if e.g. you have problems with
  the selected font.

This release was tested against X11R6 patch level 1 on an
SGI running Irix 5.2.  It has been tested against X11R5 on
SunOS 4.1.3, SunOS 5.2 (Solaris), SGI Irix 4.0.5, Gould
UTX 2.1.

Remaining Bug?
================================================================

  On startup on a Sun (but not on an SGI), keyboard input
  may not be received by the application until you move the
  mouse out of and back into the window.  Button presses are
  fine.  Does anyone know what's going on there?
  Mark Evans pointed out a fix - now in the BUG section of
  the manual page, but I would still like to hear how/why
  this happens.
