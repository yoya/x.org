* What's SJ3
	SJ3 is a Japanese input system developed by Sony Corporation.
	SJ3 is composed of Kana-Kanji conversion server(sj3serv), 
	Kana-Kanji conversion client for terminal(sj3) and Kana-Kanji
	conversion library(sj3lib).

* Configuration notice
	Default communication interface between Kana-Kanji server and client
	is socket in BSD and TLI in System V. If you want to use socket 
	in System V, you need to delete "-DTLI" from server/Imakefile and 
	sj3lib/Imakefile.
