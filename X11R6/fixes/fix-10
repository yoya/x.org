                      Release 6 Public Patch #10
                             X Consortium

This patch comes in two parts: this file and the file "fix10fonts.Z".
(The file fix10fonts.Z is 700Kb, and so is not available via the
xstuff mail daemon.  However, even if you cannot get fix10fonts.Z,
you should still apply this part so later patches won't fail for you.)

To apply this patch:

cd to the top of the source tree (to the directory containing the "xc"
and "contrib" subdirectories) and do:
        patch -p -s < ThisFile
	zcat fix10fonts.Z | patch -p -s
Patch will work silently unless an error occurs.  If you want to
watch patch do its thing, leave out the "-s" argument to patch.

To rebuild, do:
	cd xc/fonts/bdf
        make >& make.log

The file fix10fonts.Z contains patches for files in these directories:

xc/fonts/bdf/75dpi/
xc/fonts/bdf/100dpi/

Prereq: public-patch-9
