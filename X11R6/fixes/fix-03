                      Release 6 Public Patch #03
                             X Consortium

This patch comes in two parts: this file and the file "fix3docs.tar".
(The file fix3docs.tar is 1.7Mb, and so is not available via the
xstuff mail daemon.  However, even if you cannot get fix3docs.tar, you
should still apply this part so later patches won't fail for you.)

To apply this patch:

cd to the top of the source tree (to the directory containing the "xc"
and "contrib" subdirectories) and do:
        patch -p -s < ThisFile
Patch will work silently unless an error occurs.  If you want to
watch patch do its thing, leave out the "-s" argument to patch.

Next, from the same top-level directory do:
	tar xpf fix3docs.tar

No rebuild is necessary after applying this patch.

The file fix3docs.tar contains new versions of the following files:

xc/RELNOTES.PS
xc/RELNOTES.TXT
xc/doc/hardcopy/X11/xlib.PS.Z
xc/doc/hardcopy/X11/xlib.idx.PS.Z
xc/doc/hardcopy/FSProtocol/fsproto.PS.Z
xc/doc/hardcopy/man/man.PS.Z

Prereq: public-patch-2
