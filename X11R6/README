The tar files are stored in "gzip" format on our FTP server, and thus
have a ".gz" suffix.  If you cannot handle gzip compression, you can
have our FTP server convert them to "compress" (.Z) or uncompressed
format.  Changing the suffix of the filename you ask for will change
its format on the fly.  Change ".gz" to ".Z" to get compress format.
Remove the ".gz" suffix entirely to get the file uncompressed.

You may examine the file xc/bug-report to see what public patches have
been applied to your X11R6 source tree.

Note that all of the xc-?.tar.* files have changed since the initial
release versions.  You cannot mix older versions of these tar files
with the current versions.

After transferring the files, please read the Release Notes for
information on how to extract and build the software.


The core distribution is broken up into tar files as follows:

xc-1.tar	contains everything in xc/ that isn't in the other tar files
xc-2.tar	contains xc/fonts, xc/test, xc/util, xc/workInProgress
xc-3.tar	contains xc/doc/specs, xc/doc/hardcopy

The contrib software is broken up into the following files under
contrib/ in the tar files:

contrib-1.tar	LABEL, Manifest.*, Imakefile, programs A-J
contrib-2.tar	programs K-Z, Motif-based software
contrib-3.tar	Andrew
contrib-4.tar	other lib, doc, examples, extensions, fonts, test, util


See the file /GettingR6 for information on buying printed
documentation, tapes, and CD-ROMs from the X Consortium.
